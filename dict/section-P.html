<P>
<tt>P</tt> is used to link forms of the verb "be" to various words that
can be its complements: prepositions, adjectives, and passive
and progressive participles.

<PRE>
        +S-+Pp-+
        |  |   |
        He is in the yard (Pp)
        He is running (Pg)
        He was chosen (Pv)
        He was angry (Pa)
</PRE>
<P>
Some of these link-types, particularly <tt>Pg</tt> and <tt>Pa</tt>, are used
also with other verbs that take complements of these kinds.

<P>
Forms of "be" have P+, disjoined with a number of other
connectors: O+ ("He is a scientist"), K+ ("He is out"), OF+
("He is of noble birth"), and TO+ ("The idea is to do
it"). (Forms of "be" also may take no complement, with a cost
of 2: "I'm not a doctor, but she is".) Since the subscripted
forms of P+ on be need to be conjoined with other connectors
in different ways, we list them separately in the expressions.

<H3>Pp: prepositions</H3>
Pp is used to attach forms of "be" to prepositions.
Prepositions thus have "Pp-" directly disjoined with other
connectors used for attaching prepositional phrases to things
like Mp- (used for phrases modifying nouns), MVp- (used for
phrases modifying verbs), CO+ (used for openers), and so on.

<P>
A few other verbs which require prepositional complements (or
some other complement), like "get", "put (+obj)", and "let
(+obj)", also take Pp+.

<H3>Pg: present participles</H3>
Pg connects verbs that take present participles with present 
participles.

<PRE>
            +--Pg--+
            |      |
        I enjoy running
</PRE>
A number of verbs - "be", "enjoy", "like", "hate", "remember" -
take present participles as possible complements; such verbs
have "Pg+" disjoined with other complement connectors (like
O+, TO+, etc.). A few verbs take both objects and present
participles: "I saw him leaving". Such verbs take "O+ & {Pg+}".
<P>
Present participles that act as modifiers on verbs use the 
"<A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A>g" link: "He swam, leaving a wake".
Such modifiers conventionally are preceeded by a comma, as in this
example.
<P>
Present participles can also be used with no preceding verb in
so-called participle modifiers: "The dog chasing Jane was
black". Mg is used here, not Pg; this distinction relates to
post-processing (see "<A HREF="section-M.html">M</A>g").
Present participles can also be
used as subjects ("Playing the piano is fun"); such "gerund"
usages use "Ss*g+" connectors. See "<A HREF="section-S.html">S</A>s#g".
<P>
Pgf is used by post-processing to control the use of "it" and
"there". See "<A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A>: Filler-it".

<H3>Pv: passive participles</H3>
Pv is used to connect forms of "be" to passive participles:
<PRE>
              +-Pv+
              |   |
        John was hit
</PRE>
Forms of "be" have "Pv+" disjoined with their other complement
connectors (O+, Pg+, etc.).
<P>
Since the passive form of a verb is always the same as the
past participle form, the same expression can be used for
both: the "Pv-" connector is thus disjoined with the "PP-".
However, the connectors conjoined with Pv- are quite different
from those conjoined with PP-. First of all, only transitive
verbs have Pv- connectors (*"He was arrived").  Moreover, the
Pv- connector must be disjoined with the O+ connector on such
verbs, to prevent "*He was hit the dog".
<P>
When verbs take complement connectors such as "TH+", "TO+",
and "QI+", the Pv- must usually be disjoined:

<PRE>
           +--Pv-+
           |     |
        I had known of the problem
        I had known that it was a problem
        I had known what was happening

      *        Jane was known of the problem
      *        Jane was known that it was a problem
      *        Jane was known what was happening
</PRE>
The complication here is that, frequently, such constructions
are permissible when the subject is "it". 

<PRE>
        It was known that it was a problem
        It was known what was happening
</PRE>
We already have a mechanism in post-processing for ensuring
that certain complement connectors ("THi", "QIi") are only
used with "it" as the subject (see "<A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A>: Filler-it"); so these
can be used here. This produces:

<PRE>
        known: (PP- & (O+ or QI+ or TH+ or C+ ....)) or
               (Pvf- & (QIi+ or THi+...));
</PRE>
(Notice that Pvf is used here. See "<A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A>: Filler-it".)  A
further complication is that sometimes certain complements are
permitted <B>only</B> with the passive, for example: "He was known
to be clever": "*I knew him to be clever". This yields:

<PRE>
        known: (PP- & (O+ or QI+ or TH+ or C+ ....)) or
               (Pvf- & (QIi+ or THi+ or TO+...));
</PRE>
If a verb can take an object plus another complement, such as
an infinitive (O+ & TOo+) or clause (O+ & TH+), the Pv- must
be disjoined with the O+, conjoined with the other complement
connector:

<PRE>
            +--TOo-+
            +-O-+  |
            |   |  |
        I told him to go
            
            +-Pv+-TO-+
            |   |    |
        He was told  to go

        *He was told him to go
</PRE>
this yields

<PRE>
        told: (PP- & ((O+ or B-) & {TH+ or QI+ or TOo+...})) or
              (Pv- & {TH+ or QI+ or TO+});
</PRE>
(Note that for the passive, "TO" is used rather than "TOo". The
function of "TOo" is to indicate to post-processing that a new
subject is in force, by starting a new domain; but with the
passive form, a new subject is <B>not</B> in force. In "He was told
to go", "he" is the implied subject of "go".)
<P>
Sometimes one encounters what might be called a "prepositional
passive". In most cases, a passive cannot be constructed out
of a verb+preposition phrase: "I went to the house", "*The
house was gone to"; "I threw a stick at the dog", "*The dog
was thrown a stick at"; "We ate in the park", "*the park was
eaten in". There are a few cases of common verb+preposition
expressions, however, where such passives can be constructed:
"I've been yelled at, gossiped about, lied to, and trifled
with". We simply treat these as idiomatic, non-separable
expressions, similar to passive forms of transitive verbs:

<PRE>
        yelled_at lied_to: Pv- & {@MV+};
</PRE>

Pvf is used by post-processing to control the use of "it" and
"there". See "<A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A>: Filler-it".

<H3>Participle Modifiers</H3>
In participle modifiers - that is to say, in cases where
the passive participle modifies a noun directly, like
"The dog chased by Fred was black" - Mv is used, not Pv.
See "<A HREF="section-M.html">M</A>v".

<H3>Pa: predicative adjectives</H3>
Pa connects certain verbs to predicative adjectives:
<PRE>
             +-S--+-Pa-+
             |    |    |
        The dog was black
</PRE>
Only certain verbs carry Pa+ connectors ("be", "seem", "look",
"taste"). A few carry Pa+ conjoined with O+, such as "make"
and "keep": 
<PRE>
            +---Pa---+
        +-S-+-O-+    |
        |   |   |    |
        I made him happy
</PRE>
A few adjectives can act only as prenominals, not predicatives
("former", "other"); these have only A+ connectors, no Pa-.
<P>
Many adjectives can take phrasal complements when used in
predicative position: "She is eager to go", "It is not clear
who will be hired", "I am certain Joe did it", "He is fond of
cookies". On such adjectives, Pa+ is conjoined with TO+, TOi+,
TH+, Ce+, QI+, or OF+ connectors, as appropriate. Pa+ is also
conjoined with @MV+, allowing prepositional or adverbial
modifiers ("She is happy with her job"). In all these cases,
the modifying phrase is optional ("fond" is an exception: "*He
is fond").
<P>
Paf is used for post-processing, to control the use of
"filler" subjects like "it" and "there". See "<A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A>: Constraints
on Filler-Only Phrases." Regarding Pam, see
"<A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A>: Comparatives II"; regarding Pafc, 
see "<A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A>: Comparatives
IV".
<P>
Pa**j is used for verbs like "make" (mentioned above), which
take object+adjective ("I made him happy"). In such cases, the
adjective applies to the direct object, not the previous
subject; thus a new domain must be started which includes the
O and Pa links but not the S. Pa##j links therefore start "urfl
domains". Pa##j is exactly analagous to TOo and I*j; see "<A HREF="section-TO.html">TO</A>o".
</P>
<H3>Conjunctions:</H3>
Currently, the <tt>Pa</tt> link does not work well with conjunctions.
Consider:
<PRE>
      I'd make the pages smaller and the magazine thicker
</PRE>
Planarity of links implies that its the pages that get smaller, and not
the making.
