<b><tt>TH</tt></b> connects words that take "that [clause]" complements
with the word "that". These include verbs ("I assured him that..."),
nouns ("The idea that...") and adjectives ("We are certain
that...").

<PRE>
             +---TH----+
             |         |
	I assured her that I would finish the project
	The idea      that we would hire John is preposterous
	I'm certain   that she could do a good job
</PRE>
The word "that" therefore has <tt>TH- & Ce+</tt>. The
<tt><A HREF="section-C.html">Ce+</A></tt>
connects to the subject of a following clause.
<P>
Verbs that can take "that"+clause have <tt>TH+</tt> disjoined with
their other complement connectors (
<tt><A HREF="section-O.html">O+</A></tt>, 
<tt><A HREF="section-TO.html">TO+</A></tt>,
<i>etc.</i>). With many
such verbs, the "that" is optional; they thus carry
<tt>(TH+ or Ce+)</tt>, allowing a direct connection to the subject of the
subordinate clause.  Some verbs can take object+"that" ("I
told him that I was angry"); such verbs have <tt>(O+ & {TH+})</tt>.
Adjectives like "certain" have <tt>TH+</tt> disjoined with other
complement connectors. Nouns like "idea", "opinion", and
"argument" have <tt>TH+</tt> conjoined with 
<tt><A HREF="section-M.html">{@M+}</A></tt> (used in
prepositional phrases) but disjoined with
<tt>{<A HREF="section-R.html">R+</A> & <A HREF="section-B.html">B+</A>}</tt>
(used in relative clauses); this is somewhat arbitrary.
<P>
<b><tt>THb+</tt></b> connectors are used to connect forms of "be" to "that".
The reason for this is that only certain nouns can serve as
the subject in such cases: "The problem is that John is
coming", "*The dog is that John is coming". To enforce this,
we give such nouns <tt>Ss*t+</tt> connectors instead of the usual
<tt>Ss+</tt>.  We then insist in post-processing that a group
containing a <tt>THb</tt> must contain an <tt>Ss#t</tt>.
<P>
<b><tt>THi+</tt></b> connectors occur on certain adjectives ("important")
which may only take "that+clause" when "filler-it" is the
subject.  This distinction involves post-processing.  See
"<b><tt><A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A></tt></b>: Filler-it"
for further explanation.
<P>
<b><tt>THc</tt></b> is used with comparatives; see 
"<b><tt><A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A></tt></b>: Comparatives VI".
