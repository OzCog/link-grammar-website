<tt>D</tt> connects determiners to nouns.

<PRE>
         +-D-+
         |   |
        The dog ran
</PRE>

Nouns have <tt>D-</tt>connectors conjoined with their main 
"<tt>S+ or O- or J-...</tt>" expression.
The <tt>D-</tt>is listed first on the expression,
since it must connect closer than the main connection: "I saw
the dog", "*The I saw dog".
<P>
Many words can act as either determiners or noun-phrases: "some",
"many", "all", "this", and a number of others. Such words have
<tt>D-</tt> disjoined with the main "<tt>S+ or O-...</tt>" found on nouns:

<PRE>
        many: Dmc+ or Sp+ or O-...;
</PRE>

The first two subscript places on <tt>D</tt> connectors relate to number
agreement. Consider the following simplified entries.

<PRE>
	the: D+;
	a: Ds+;
	some: Dm+;
	many: Dmc+;
	much: Dmu+;

	dog: Ds- & ...;
	dogs: {Dmc-} & ...;
	water: {Dmu-} & ...;
	war: {D*u-} & ...;
</PRE>
	
Essentially there are three categories of noun and determiner:
singular, mass, and plural.  The first subscript place
distinguishes between singular ("s") and everything else
("m"); the second place distinguishes between plural ("c") and
mass ("u") (for "countable" and "uncountable"). Nouns and
articles which are singular-only have Ds; those which
are plural-only have Dmc; those which are mass-only have Dmu;
nouns which may be singular or mass have D*u-; determiners which
may be plural or mass have Dm+; and determiners which may be
mass, plural or singular have D+. (A few nouns, such as "fish",
may be plural or singular; for these we create multiple 
dictionary entries.)

<h3><tt>Dmcn</tt>: Numeric determiners</h3>
The <tt>Dmcn</tt> determiner is used for numeric quantifiers, such as
<PRE>
      +--Dmcn-+
      |       |
   twenty cookies

</PRE>
As explained above, the "m" subscript is for "multiple", the "c"
subscript is for "count"; so "n" here indicates "numeric".
This connector has essentially the same meaning
as the <tt><A HREF="section-ND.html">ND</A></tt> numeric determiner. 
A future version may (or may not!) make one of these two links 
obsolete.

<h3><tt>D**w</tt>: Question-determiners</h3>
The third subscript place on <tt>D</tt> connectors relates only to
post-processing. <tt>D**w</tt> connectors are used for question-
determiners: "which", "what" and "whose". The "w" triggers
post-processing constraints relating to question-inversion;
see "<tt><A HREF="section-SI.html">SI</A></tt>: Questions without s-v inversion".
D**w connectors are
conjoined on question-determiners with other left-pointing
connectors (<tt>QI-</tt> and </tt>W-</tt>);
therefore such determiners cannot be
used in normal declarative sentences, since no linkage will be
found ("*I bought which eggs today"). Other false positives arise
here which require post-processing; see "<tt><A HREF="section-B.html">B</A></tt>: More about dependent
clauses".

<h3><tt>Ds**v, Ds**c, Ds**x</tt>: Phonetic agreement</h3>
The <tt>Ds**v</tt> and <tt>Ds**c</tt> connectors are used to enforce
phonetic agreement of "a" and "an" when used with nouns that begin
with a consonant or a vowel, respectively.  Thus, for example,
the <tt>Ds**v</tt> connector will link only to nouns starting with
a vowel:
<PRE>
          +-Ds**v-+
          |       |
    I ate an    apple

</PRE>
The <tt>Ds**c</tt> connector will link only to nouns starting with 
a consonant:
<PRE>
          +-Ds**c-+
          |       |
    I ate a     pear
</PRE>

The <tt>Ds**x</tt> connector will link only to nouns that are preceeded
by a modifier, thus invalidating the need for phonetic agreement. In this
case the <tt><a href="section-PH.html">PH</a></tt> connector is used to
force phonetic agreement.
<PRE>
          +--Ds**x--+
          |         |
    I ate a green apple
</PRE>


<h3>Determiners and Adjectives on Proper Nouns</h3>
In general, proper nouns do not take determiners. However, there
are a number of exceptions. A number of proper nouns may take
the determiner "the": "The Emir of Kuwait died", "The Supreme 
Soviet met today". For this we use the DG connector; see
"<tt><A HREF="section-DG.html">DG</A></tt>". Beyond this, however, one quite often sees proper names
taking determiners, for example with brand-names or with people.

<PRE>
	?The new David Letterman is a happy, secure David Letterman.
	?I bought a Toyota to carry my Macintosh 
</PRE>

Thus we give proper nouns <tt>D-</tt> with cost 2. Note that in the first
case the proper noun carries an adjective as well; this is also
not uncommon in more colloquial writing. Thus proper nouns carry

<PRE>
	[[{@A-} & {D-}]] & (Ss+ or O- or J-...)
</PRE>

In giving proper nouns <tt>D-</tt> and <tt>A-</tt> connectors, we are
essentially allowing them to be treated like common
nouns. Other common-noun-like usages are not permitted: we do
not allow proper nouns to act as plural forms or to take
post-nominal modifiers such as prepositional phrases (but see
"<tt><A HREF="section-JG.html">JG</A></tt>"). These usages do occasionally arise, however - with
brand-names, for example. Some words for nations and
religions, such as "American(s)" and "Muslim(s)", really seem
like full-blown common nouns; thus they are included in
ordinary common noun categories.

<P>
Other <tt>D</tt> subscripts relate to comparatives; 
see "<tt><A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A></tt>: Comparatives",
sections I (<tt>Dm*m</tt>) and VII (<tt>Dm*y</tt>). <tt>Dm*k</tt>
and <tt>Ds*k</tt> relate to the
construction "such...that"; 
see "<tt><A HREF="section-EA.html">EA</A></tt>xk: so...that".
