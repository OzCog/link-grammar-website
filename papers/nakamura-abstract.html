Nakamura & Kanade, Semantic Analysis for Video Contents Extraction:
Spotting by Association in News Video.
(Abstract)</h2>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Spotting by Association method for video analysis is a novel method to
detect video segments with typical semantics. Video data contains
various kinds of information through continuous images, natural
language, and sound. For videos to be stored and retrieved in a
Digital Libmry, it is essential to segment the video data into
meaningful pieces. To detect meaningful segments, we need to identify
the segment in each modality (video, language, and sound) that
corresponds to the same story. For this purpose, we propose a new
method for making correspondences between image clues detected by
image analysis and language clues detected by natural language
analysis. As a result, relevant video segments with sufficient
information from every modality are obtained. We applied our method to
closed-captioned CNN Headline News. Video segments with important
events, such as a public speech, meeting, or visit, are detected
fairly well.
