<P>
PF is used in cases of fronted prepositional and participle
phrases, typically (but not always) occurring together with
subject-verb inversion.
The <tt>PFb</tt> link is used for copular inversion, while the
plain <tt>PF</tt> link is used for locative and directive inversion.
The <tt><a href="section-CP.html">CP</a></tt> link is used for
quotative inversion.

<PRE>
          +---------PFb-------+-SI-+
          |                   |    |
        Among the candidates was Jane Smith, a professor
        Carrying the box     was a small child
        ?Described by John   was a new program

          +---------PF--------+-SI--+
          |                   |     |
        Under the tree      slept  Jim
        Into the room       walked two students

          +---------PFt-------+-SI--+
          |                   |     |
        There                lay the money
</PRE>

Such phrases vary widely in their acceptability, depending on
the participle or preposition; we allow all participles and
most prepositions to be used this way, but only with a cost of
1 or 2.  The <tt>PFt</tt> link cannot connect to <tt>PFb</tt>
and thus serves to prevent "there is" from being interpreted
as an S-V inversion.

<P>
Such fronting can occur even without S-V inversion:
<PRE>
          +------------PFt---------+
          |                        |
        There              he transferred the remains
        There the remains can be found
</PRE>
In this example, "the remains" acts as the subject to "found" and occurs
in normal sentence order.

<P>
These phrases are not to be confused with openers.
Openers attach to the subject of an ordinary main clause,
which does not have s-v inversion and can have any verb:
"Carrying the box, Jane left". Fronted prepositional or
participle constructions involve s-v inversion.

<P>
In such cases, the fronted phrase must attach to the wall;
the <tt><a href="section-W.html">Wp</a></tt> link is used for
this purpose.  S-V inversion is necessary
here ("*Among the candidates Jane Smith was"); thus the
participle makes a <tt>Wp</tt> connection to the wall, enforcing
s-v inversion in post-processing.

<PRE>
        among:    J+ & (Mp- or MVp- or ... [[Wp- & PF+]])
        carrying: (Pg- & (O+...))   or    
            ((O+...) & (Ss*g+ or COp+ or [[Wp- & PF+]]));
</PRE>

For participles, note that the <tt>Wp- & PF+</tt> complex is
directly disjoined with the <tt>COp+</tt> and <tt>Ss*g+</tt>,
and is to the right of the
complement expression; it is fully disjoined with the <tt>Pg-</tt>,
which is to the left of its complement expression.  See 
<tt><A HREF="section-CO.html">CO</A>:
Participles as Openers</tt> for an explanation.

<P>
<H3>Obsolete form</h3>
Earlier versions of the dictionary used <tt>PF</tt> in certain
direct and indirect questions with "be".  This usage has been 
entirely replaced by <tt><A HREF="section-Q.html">Qw</A></tt>, which
links to the WH-words used to front questions.  The description
below is maintained to document this older behavior.

<P>
Normally forms of "be" require a complement to the right; but
they can also be satisfied by a question-word to the left like
"where", "when" or "how".

<PRE>
      +-Wq--+-PF-+-SI+
      |     |    |   |
    ///// Where are you

                +--PF----+
          +--QI-+    +-S-+
          |     |    |   |
     I wonder where you are

</PRE>
Forms of "be" thus have PF- directly disjoined with "O+ or Pg+
or Pv+...".
<P>
The question-words "where" and "when" have PF- conjoined with
Wq- or QI-. In questions, then, a Wq- connection to the wall
is made, enforcing s-v inversion (see 
"<A HREF="section-SI.html">SI</A>"); in indirect questions,
an QI connection is made, preventing s-v inversion.

<P>
Note that other verbs cannot be used in this way: "*Where ran
you", "*What think you", "*What have you?" The first two cases
are prevented because ordinary verbs don't have SI+
connectors; the third is prevented because, although "have"
has an SI+, it is conjoined only with PP+ (used in
past-participles) and not with O+ and B- (used with direct
objects). Only on forms of "be" is the SI+ conjoined with the
entire complement expression.
