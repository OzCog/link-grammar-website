<tt>RJ</tt> is used to connect adverbs, and in various other, miscellaneous 
conjoined phrases and clauses.

<PRE>
               +---------MVr--------+          
       +---Ss--+---Ox--+    +--RJlv-+---RJrv--+
       |       |       |    |       |         |
      she handled.v-d it quickly and.j-r gracefully 
</PRE>
In the above example, the <tt>RJ</tt> links join the adverbs
"quickly" and "gracefully" to the central coordinator "and".  The "and"
acts as a head-word, connecting as if it were an adverb itself:
joining with an <tt>MV</tt> link to the modified verb on the left.
</P>
<P>
The subtypes <tt>RJl, RJr</tt>, standing for "left" and "right",
are used to maintain sequential ordering, which is important for
comma-separated lists of adverbs; thus, for example:
<PRE>
               +--------------MVr-------------+          
               |                 +----RJlv----+          
               |            +RJlv+RJrv+       +---RJrv--+
               |            |    |    |       |         |
      she handled.v-d it quickly , quietly and.j-r gracefully 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Besides adverbs, the RJ link is used for various prepositional, relative and
subordinate clauses:
<ul>
<li><tt>RJ*c</tt>: conjoined subordinate clauses: "Although he said ...
     and he did ..., ..."
<li><tt>RJ*j</tt>: conjoined prepositional-object-relative (Mj) phrases:
     "the man for whom and with whom ..."
<li><tt>RJ*r</tt>: conjoined "those" relative clauses: 
     "...: those who do and those who don't"
<li><tt>RJ*t</tt>: conjoined that: "He said that ... and that ..."
<li><tt>RJ*v</tt>: conjoined adverbs
</ul>
</P>
