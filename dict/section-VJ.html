<b><tt>VJ</tt></b> connects verbs to the word "and" to create a conjoined modifier
phrase.

<PRE>
       +---Ss---+          
       |  +--VJ-+--VJ--+
       |  |     |      |
      he ran and.j-v jumped
</PRE>
In the above example, the <tt>VJ</tt> links join the verbs "ran" and
"jumped" to the central coordinator "and".  The "and" acts as a
head-word, connecting to the subject as if it were a verb itself:
joining with the <tt>S</tt> link to the subject on the left.
</P>
<P>
There are many subtypes to the <tt>VJ</tt> link; these are summarized
here, and reviewed in detail below.
<dl>
<dt><b>First position</b></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><tt>VJr</tt> - left
<li><tt>VJl</tt> - right
<li><tt>VJd</tt> - ditransitive
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>Second position</b></dt>
<dd>
Controls agreement with subject
<ul>
<li><tt>VJ*s</tt> - singular subject
<li><tt>VJ*p</tt> - plural subject
<li><tt>VJ*g</tt> - conjoined gerunds
<li><tt>VJ*h</tt> - conjoined past participles
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>Third position</b></dt>
<dd>
Controls whether the conjunction can take an object.
<ul>
<li><tt>VJ**i</tt> - intranstive
<li><tt>VJ**t</tt> - transitive
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</P>
<P>
The subtypes <tt>VJl, VJr</tt>, standing for "left" and "right",
are used to maintain sequential ordering, which is important for
comma-separated lists of verbs; thus, for example:
<PRE>
       +----Ss---+-----VJrsi-----+          
       |    +VJls+      +--VJlsi-+--VJrsi--+
       |    |    |      |        |         |
      he ran.v-d , jumped.v-d and.j-v scored.v-d 
</PRE>
Notice that when infinitives are used, then the
<a href="section-XJ.html"><tt>XJ</tt> link</a> is used instead.  
This is probably a design flaw, and the approach taken for 
<tt>XJi</tt> links should be harmonized with that for
the other <tt>XJ</tt> link styles.
</P>
<P>
The subtype <tt>VJd</tt> is used to conjoin ditransitive objects
(where the verb takes for a direct and indirect object):
<PRE>
              +----------VJd---------+                
              +------Osn------+      +------Osn------+
       +-Sp*i-+--Os--+   +-Ds-+      +---Os--+   +-Ds+
       |      |      |   |    |      |       |   |   |
      I.p gave.v-d Bob.m a doll.n and.j-o Mary.b a gun.n 
</PRE>
There are many "complex" transitive verbs that can be conjoined in a 
fashion similar to the above: transitive verbs that take particles,
transitive verbs that can connect to phrases headed by <i>to ...</i>
or <i>that ...</i>.  While the <tt>VJd</tt> subtype handles the
most common case, that of ditransitive verbs, the more complex cases
are not handled, or are not consistently handled in link-grammar.
See also the discussion of this phenomenon in the page introducing
conjunctions in link-grammar.
</P>
<P>
The subtype <tt>VJ*s</tt> is used to enforce singular subjects:
<PRE>
       +-----Ss-----+          
       |    +-VJlsi-+--VJrsi--+
       |    |       |         |
      he ran.v-d and.j-v jumped.v-d 
</PRE>
The subtype <tt>VJ*p</tt> is used to enforce plural subjects:
<PRE>
        +------Sp-----+          
        |     +-VJlpi-+--VJrpi--+
        |     |       |         |
      they ran.v-d and.j-v jumped.v-d 
</PRE>
The subtype <tt>VJ*g</tt> is used to conjoin gerunds:
<PRE>
            +--------Pg*b-------+          
       +-Ss-+        +---VJlg---+---VJrg--+
       |    |        |          |         |
      he was.v-d running.v and.v-fill jumping.v 
</PRE>
The subtype <tt>VJ*h</tt> is used to conjoin past participles:
<PRE>
            +------PP-----+          
       +-Ss-+      +-VJlh-+--VJrht--+
       |    |      |      |         |
      he had.v-d run.v and.j-v jumped.v-d 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The <tt>VJ**i</tt> and <tt>VJ**t</tt> subtypes control whether 
a conjunction can take an object.  The conjunction should take an 
object if both verbs are transitive; for example, <i>I saw and 
greeted Sue</i>, which should group together the verbs:
<i>I (saw and greeted) Sue</i>, with the <i>and</i> acting
as the head work, connnecting to the subject, and to the object:
<PRE>
       +-----Sp*i----+--------Os--------+
       |     +-VJlpt-+--VJrpt--+        |
       |     |       |         |        |
      I.p saw.v-d and.j-v greeted.v-d Sue.f 
</PRE>
The above may be interpreted as two sentences: <i>I saw Sue</i>
and <i>I greeted Sue</i>.  By contrast, 
the subtype <tt>VJ**i</tt> is used to explicitly prohibit the
above case, when one of the verbs is not transitive:
<PRE>
       +-----Sp*i-----+             
       |      +-VJlpi-+-VJrpi+--Os-+
       |      |       |      |     |
      I.p fell.v-d and.j-v saw.w Sue.f 
</PRE>
That is, one cannot say <i>*I fell Sue</i>; the verb <i>to fall</i>
is not transtive (not to be confused with the verb <i>to fell</i>,
as in <i>to fell a tree</i>).
