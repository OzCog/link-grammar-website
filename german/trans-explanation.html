<h2>English-to-German Translation and German Parsing</h2>
<p>

<p>With version 4.0, we are releasing a simple prototype 
system for translating English to German. We are also releasing
a simple German dictionary which can be used for parsing sentences,
similar to the standard link grammar English dictionary. These 
materials are found in the directory "translator", parallel to the
directory "link-4.0" in the ftp directory.

<p><b>The German Dictionary. </b>The German dictionary can be parsed
like a regular dictionary, in the following fashion.  (This should be
done from inside the link-4.0 directory. It requires that the
directories are set up in the same way as in the ftp directory.)

<pre>
     parse ../translator/german.dict -a ../translator/german.affix -ppoff -coff
</pre>
<p>We will not attempt to explain the logic of the German dictionary in
depth. Obviously it is similar to the English ones in certain ways,
reflecting similarities between English and German syntax. One
important
difference is that in the German dictionary, the "head" of a clause -
the word which attaches to the outside world - is the finite verb,
rather
than the subject noun:

<pre>

    +-------------------W------------------+
    |      +---------------CO--------------+
    |      +-------------Xc------------+   |
    |      +-----------C-----------+   |   |
    |      |   +---------Si--------+   |   +----Pa----+
    |      |   |   +---B--+--PPIt--+   |   +-SIi+     |
    |      |   |   |      |        |   |   |    |     |
LEFT-WALL als ich ihn gesehen.v habe.v , war.i ich froh.a
</pre>

<p>This is necessary, because in many cases the finite verb in a
German clause (e.g. "war" in the sentence above) precedes the subject
noun, but also connects to a word (a participle or adjective) further
to the right. Having the subject noun connect to the left of the
finite verb would prevent this connection. The above sentence
illustrates another important difference as well: often, the
link-types found in English grammar appear in inverted forms. Instead
of an O link connecting a verb to a following direct object, we find a
B link connecting them in the reverse order (of course B links are
used also in English, e.g. in relative clauses). We may also find PPI
links (instead of PP) connecting a form of "have" to a preceding past
participle, II links (instead of I) connecting a verb to a preceding
infinitive participle, and so on.

<p>Connector subscripts prove to be extremely useful in the German
dictionary, to enforce the complex rules of agreement between noun
and verb forms, articles and nouns, and adjectives and nouns. In the
case of nouns, for example, we have this:

<pre>
     (((({@Ae-} & Dnmd-) or ({@Ar-} & Dnmi-)) & (Ss+ or SIs- or (Xd- & Xc+ & MX-))) or
     ({@An-} & Dam- & (O- or J*a- or B+)) or ({@An-} & Ddm- & (J*d- or JB+)));
</pre>

<p>Notice that different forms of the "D-" connector are conjoined with
the S+ / SI-, O-, and J- connectors, indicating that different forms
of article are needed depending on the case. (J*a- and J*d- indicate
accusative and dative prepositions, respectively.) Also, different
forms of adjective (A-) are needed in the nominative case, depending on
whether the article is definite ("der") or indefinite ("ein").

<p><b>The English to German Translator.</b> The "translator" directory
also contains a program for translating English into German. The
program accepts an English sentence as input, and it parses it in the
usual way. It then turns the resulting linkage into a "linkset"-- an
unordered set of links. It replaces the English words with German
equivalents, using "tables" (similar to link grammar dictionaries in
format) representing these correspondences. It then manipulates the
links of the linkset, replacing some links with others, adding and
deleting some, etc., as required by German syntax. Finally, it uses
the German dictionary (described above) to turn the new German linkage
back into an ordered sequence of words. Click <a

online version of the translator; this version also provides a
tutorial which gives more detail about the workings of the translator.
