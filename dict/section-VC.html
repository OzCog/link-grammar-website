<tt>VC</tt> is used mainly to connect clauses to various words
when they act as a subordinating conjunction. It is quite similar
to the <tt><A HREF="section-MV.html">MVs</A></tt> connector, which
is used in many similar situations, however, the <tt>VC</tt> link
is "tighter", in that it must always for a cycle with som other link,
typically either <tt><a href="section-X.html">X</a></tt> or
<tt><a href="section-CP.html">CP</a></tt>.
By contrast, the coordinating conjunctions primarily use the
<tt><A HREF="section-X.html">Xx</A></tt> connector.
<pre>
         +----------Xs---------+                     
         +----->WV----->+      +-------CV----->+     
         +--Wd--+--Sp*i-+--VC--+Cs+-Sp*i+---I--+-Ox-+
         |      |       |      |  |     |      |    |
     LEFT-WALL I.p stayed.v-d so I.p could.v see.v you 
</pre>

<tt>VC</tt> is used for coordination only, and it links
to the head-verb of the previous clause. This is consistent
with how subordinating conjunctions are linked, such as
"when" and "after".  See
"<A HREF="section-W.html">W</A>: Coordinating Conjunctions"; and also the
<A HREF="coordination.html">coordination overview</A>.

<P>
<H3>VCq: Conditionals</H3>
Another use of <tt>VC</tt> is in conditional constructions like this
one. 

<pre>
              +--VCq--+-SI-+
              |       |    |
      I would do it, were it possible
</pre>

Here, <tt>VCq</tt> is used. Instead of linking to the subject of the
following clause, the <tt>VCq</tt> links to a following auxiliary
(either "had" or "were"), which is then forced to use an
"SI*j+", creating subject-verb inversion.  Conditional
expressions can also be used as openers in this way: "Had you
been there, I would have seen you". For this, <tt>COp</tt> is used.
For this purpose, "had" and "were" have a special 
"<tt>SI*j+ &amp; (VCq- or COp+)</tt>" expression. 
<P>
<H3>VCz: Paraphrasing-like constructions</H3>
The <tt>VCz</tt> is used to to connect to the adverbial form of "as",
whenever it is used in paraphrasing-like constructions expresing
desire, beleif, thoughts, etc. (The <tt><a href="section-E.html">Eq</a></tt>
together with the <tt><a href="section-CP.html">CP</a></tt>
are used for more direct paraphrasing, and for quotations).
The <tt>VCz</tt> interplays with other link types in a complex fashion:
<PRE>
       +----------------->CPu----------------->+
       +----->WV----->+---VCz---+------CV----->+
       +->Wd--+---Ss--+     +-Xd+-Sa*a+---Pv---+
       |      |       |     |   |     |        |
   LEFT-WALL she   failed   ,   as   was     hoped    
</PRE>
Here, the <tt>CPu</tt> link connects from the left wall to the
verb expressing the desire. It forms a cycle with <tt>VCz</tt>,
although it depends on the head-verb connectors
<tt><a href="section-WV.html">WV</a></tt> and
<tt><a href="section-CV.html">CV</a></tt> to accomplish this.
The <tt>CV</tt> link in turn forms a cycle, using the unusual
<tt><a href="section-S.html">Sa</a></tt> link to "as",
in place of the missing subject doing the hoping.
