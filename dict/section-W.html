<P>
<tt>W</tt> is used to attach the subject of main clauses to the wall
(hereafter "the wall" means the left-wall). Almost all kinds of main clauses -
declaratives, most questions (object-type, subject-type,
where/when/why, and prepositional), and imperatives - use a <tt>W</tt>
of some kind to attach to the wall. The only exception is
"yes-no" questions, which attach to the wall with <tt>Q</tt>. 
See "<tt><A HREF="section-Q.html">Q</A></tt>".
The <tt><A HREF="section-WV.html">WV</A></tt> attaches the main verb
of the main caluse to the wall; thus, <tt>W</tt> and <tt>WV</tt> form 
a cycle. See <tt><A HREF="section-WV.html">WV</A></tt> for more details.

</PRE>

<P>
Note that the wall is automatically inserted at the beginning
of every sentence, and is then treated like a normal word; by
the connectivity rule, therefore, it <B>must</B> make some kind of
connection to the sentence. The wall thus has "<tt>W+ or Q+</tt>". 

<P>
<tt>W</tt> is also used to attach clauses back to coordinating
conjunctions in declarative sentences; coordinating
conjunctions thus have "<tt>CC- &amp; (Wd+ or Wq+ or Ws+)</tt>".
<tt>CC</tt> then makes a link back to the subject of the previous main
clause.

<P>
<H3>Wd: Declarative Sentences</H3>
<tt>Wd</tt> is used in ordinary declarative sentences, to connect the
main clause back to the wall (or to a previous coordinating
conjunction). Nouns carry <tt>Wd-</tt>, optionally conjoined with their
<tt>S+</tt> connectors. <tt>Wd-</tt> on nouns is directly disjoined with
<tt>C-</tt> (used in dependent clauses) and <tt>R-</tt> (used in some relative
clauses); see "<A HREF="section-C.html">C</A>".

<PRE>
      dog: (({@CO-} &amp; Wd-) or ({@CO-} &amp; C-) or R+) &amp; S+
</PRE>

<H3>Wp, Wr: verb modifier inversions</H3>

<tt>Wp</tt> and <tt>Wr</tt> are used to avoid a link-crossing whenever
a verb modifier occurs first in the sentence, before the subject. This
is required because the usual use of <tt>Wd</tt> to the head-noun of
the sentence would interfer with the link between the modifier and verb.

<PRE>
    +-------------->WV-------------->+
    |        +<---------PFt<---------+
    +-->Wp-->+                       |
    |        |                       |
  /////    here the remains can be found

    +---------->WV--------->+
    |        +<-----PF<-----+

    |        |              |        |
  /////    down the stairs came the dog   

</PRE>

The <tt>Wp</tt> link is used for both locative and directive inversions.
For comparative inversion, <tt>Wr</tt> is used to link to the 
fronted comparative adjective.
For quotative inversion, the <tt><A HREF="section-CP.html">CP</A></tt>
link is used.
For questions, <tt>Wq</tt>, <tt>Ws</tt> and <tt>Wj</tt> links are used;
see below.
For locative declarations without a verb, the <tt>Wl</tt> link is used.

<P>
<H3>Wq, Ws, Wj, Ww, Wb, Wv, Wh: Questions</H3> 
<tt>Wq</tt>, <tt>Ws</tt>, <tt>Wj</tt>, <tt>Ww</tt>, <tt>Wh</tt>
and <tt>Wb</tt>
are used to connect many types of questions to the wall:
subject questions (<tt>Ws</tt>),
object questions (<tt>Wq</tt> and <tt>Wh</tt>),
where/when/why questions (<tt>Wq</tt> and <tt>Ww</tt>), 
adjectival questions (<tt>Wq</tt>),
prepositional questions (<tt>Wj</tt>), 
topic questions (<tt>Wb</tt>), and
action questions (<tt>Wv</tt>).
Each of these link types
interacts heavily with post-processing.  See 
"<tt><A HREF="section-SI.html">SI</A></tt>" for an
explanation of <tt>Wq</tt> and <tt>Ws</tt>; see 
"<tt><A HREF="section-JQ.html">JQ</A></tt>" for an explanation of
<tt>Wj</tt>.
See <tt>Wt</tt> below for an example of <tt>Wb</tt>.
The <tt>Ww</tt> link is used for questioning exclamations in which
there is no head verb that can link to the wall. When there is
a head verb, then <tt>Wq</tt> is used.
<P>
The <tt>Wv</tt> link is used for "why?" questions with an action verb:
"why run away?"
<P>
The <tt>Wh</tt> link is used for "how?" questions with an object:
<PRE>
      +------->Wa-------+
      +->Wh--+--H-+-Dmc-+
      |      |    |     |
    /////   how many times.n
</PRE>
This is unusual, in that two <tt>W</tt> links appear: one to the
question-word, and one to the object. This is analogous to verb
questions, where <tt>WV</tt> links the wall to the verb; here, however,
the <tt>Wa</tt> link is used to connect the object to the wall.

<P>
<H3>Wt: Topic sentences</H3> 
Most sentences start with a subject; a few start with the topic, instead.
The <tt>Wt</tt> link is used to link the topic to the wall.  For example:
<PRE>
            +------------B------------+
            |           +-----I*d-----+
    +---Wt--+--Rn-+-Sp*i+---N--+      |
    |       |     |     |      |      |
  /////   that    I    did    not   know
</PRE>
The B link points to the left, from the head-verb (know) to the topic
(that). In the above, ther is no way to link the subject (I) to the 
wall, without crossing the B link. Thus, the Wt link serves to start
the sentence.
<P>
Topic questions have a similar structure:
<PRE>
            +-------BW---------+
            |     +-----I*d----+
    +---Wb--+--Rw-+-SIp-+      |
    |       |     |     |      |
  /////   what   do    you   think
</PRE>


<P>
<H3>Wo: Infinitive sentences</H3> 
Examples include: "To be continued", "To be determined later."

<P>
<H3>Wa: Affirmative replies</H3> 
<tt>Wa</tt> is used to connect null-verb sentences to the wall.
Null-verb sentences typically occur as affirmative answers to questions:
"What did you see?"  "A red car." "Who was in it?"  "John's evil twin." 
"When did this happen?"  "June 10th."
Thus:
<PRE>
    +------Wa------+
    |    +----Ds---+
    |    |   +--A--+
    |    |   |     |
  /////  a red.a car.n 
</PRE>
<P>

<H3>Wi: Imperatives</H3>
<tt>Wi</tt> is used to connect imperatives to the wall.

<PRE>
     +--Wi-+
     |     |
  /////    Go away
</PRE>

<P>
Imperative verb forms have "<tt>Wi-</tt>", conjoined with their
complement connectors. Since the imperative verb form is
always the same as the infinitive form (and the plural,
in every case except "be"), the same expression can be
used. Infinitive verbs thus carry

<PRE>
      (Sp- or I- or Wi-) &amp; [complement];
</PRE>

<H3>Wg: Participles</H3>
<tt>Wg</tt> is used to connect participles to the wall. These frequently
occur as answers to interrogatives, such as "what are you doing?",
"What did you do?", or are diary entries, to-do list entries.

<PRE>
     +>--------Wg-------+
     |                  |
  /////               Going shopping!
  /////               Sang with the church choir today
  /////    Frequently chats with the grocer
</PRE>

<P>
<H3>Wn: Nominal objects</H3>
<tt>Wn</tt> is used to connect nominal object sentences to the wall.
These are sentences having only the object, and inverted: for example,
"what a mess [this is]" or "what a great day [it is] today".

<PRE>
             +---Os---+
     +---Wn--+  +Ds**c+
     |       |  |     |
  /////    what a    mess
</PRE>

<H3>Wx: Opinion expressions</H3>
<tt>Wx</tt> is used to connect opinion expressions to the wall.

<PRE>
     +-----Xp----+
     +--Wx--+    |
     |      |    |
  /////   sad.a  !
</PRE>

<P>
<H3>Wl: Locative expressions</H3>
<tt>Wl</tt> is used for locative expressions that don't have a verb.
These commonly occur as replies to questions such as "where is it?"
or "when did happen?"

<PRE>
            +---Js--+
     +--Wl--+  +-Ds-+
     |      |  |    |
  /////    on the table
</PRE>

Such expressions can be conjoined, and become quite long; for example,
"on the table, just to the left of the lamp, just over there".

<P>
<H3>Wc: Coordinating Conjunctions</H3>
There are a number of words that serve to link clauses together:
coordinating conjunctions like "and" and "but", and subordinating
conjunctions like "after" and "because".

<PRE>
      +---CC---+-Wd+
      |        |   |
    John left but he returned later

           +-MVs+-Cs+
           |    |   |
    John left after I saw you
</PRE>

<P>
Note that subordinating and coordinating conjunctions use very
different linking structures. First of all, both the left-pointing
and right-pointing connectors on the conjunctions are different;
"but" has "<tt>CC- &amp; Wd+</tt>", "after" has "<tt>MVs- &amp; Cs+</tt>". Secondly, 
coordinating conjunctions connect back to the subject of the
previous clause, subordinating conjunctions to the verb.
There are several reasons for making these distinctions.
First of all, coordinating conjunctions may not be used in
relative clauses:

<PRE>
      *The man I tried to hit but Jane stopped me is here
      *The man I tried to stop Jane but she hit is here
      *The man I hit but Jane comforted is here
</PRE>

<P>
(There are other constraints on relative clauses: the main
noun of a relative clause may not link to something inside an
embedded clause.  We handle this using <tt>Ce</tt> and <tt>Cs</tt>;
see "<tt><A HREF="section-C.html">C</A></tt>".)
So, we need to prevent these constructions. Coordinating
conjunctions have another related property. They may be used
to connect clauses in sequence, like subordinating
conjunctions. But whereas subordinating conjunctions seem to
link in a nested way, with each modifying the last,
coordinating conjunctions seem to "leap" over any preceding
subordinating conjunctions:

<PRE>
          +------------+-C-+-S-+------+--C--+--S--+
          |            |   |   |      |     |     |
     1. John screamed when I arrived after Sue  left (seems right)

                           +---- ? ---+
          +------------+-C-+-S-+      +--W--+--S--+
          |            |   |   |      |     |     |
     2. John screamed when I arrived but   Sue   left (seems wrong)

          +-------------CC------------+
          +------------+-C-+-S-+      +--C--+--S--+
          |            |   |   |      |     |     |
     3. John screamed when I arrived but   Sue   left (seems right)
</PRE>

<P>
We handle this in the following way. In the first place,
coordinating conjunctions link to the left not with <tt>MVs-</tt>, like
other conjunctions, but with <tt>CC-</tt>.

<PRE>
      and but: CC- &amp; W+;
      dog: {R- or C- or (W- &amp; {CC+})} &amp; S+...;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that subject nouns may make a <tt>CC</tt> connection to the right,
but only if a <tt>W</tt> is being made to the left (<i>i.e.</i>, if the noun
in a subject of a main clause), not if a <tt>C</tt> is being made. In
other words, while subordinating conjunctions connect to the
main verb of the nearest clause to the left, coordinating
conjunctions connect to the <B>subject</B> of the nearest <B>main</B>
clause to the left.  Thus ex. 3 above is allowed, but ex. 2 is
prevented. The problem with relative clauses is solved also.
In relative clauses, the main subject of the relative always
makes either a <tt>C-</tt> or an <tt>R-</tt> to the left, and neither one is
conjoined with <tt>CC+</tt>; so no coordinating conjunctions can
appear.

<P>
Note that the above expressions also allow coordinating
conjunctions to link clauses in sequence:

<PRE>
          +-------CC---+--W-+---CC--+-W-+
          |            |    |       |   |
        Jane screamed and Fred ran but Dave cried
</PRE>

<P>
Coordinating conjunctions may also connect directly to the
wall: "<tt>And Jane screamed</tt>". Thus they carry a "<tt>Wc-</tt>" connector,
which can link to the wall's <tt>W+</tt>. Furthermore, a coordinating
conjunction may link to a following question, rather than to a
declarative clause. They may not, however, link from a
question to a declarative clause:

<PRE>
   I know you don't like Joe, but why did you send him that nasty note
   *Why did you send Joe that nasty note, but I know you don't like him
</PRE>

<P>
Thus we give such conjunctions the following:

<PRE>
    (CC- or Wc-) &amp; (Wd+ or Wq+ or Ws+ or Qd+);
</PRE>

<P>
Another reason for distinguishing between <tt>W</tt> and <tt>C</tt> is that
certain openers like participle openers may be used in main
clauses but not dependent ones; see "<A HREF="section-CO.html">CO</A>: Participles as openers".

<P>
<H3>We: Ellipses</H3>
<tt>We</tt> is used to connect ellipses to the wall.

<PRE>
     +---We--+
     |       |
  /////     ... like a shot
</PRE>
An ellipsis denotes the intentional ommission of a part of a sentence.
Very little can be assumed about what has been omitted, other than
that it must have been grammatical.  Thus, <tt>We-</tt> is conjoined with a
reasonably broad set of generic links, so that the trailing phrase
can parse properly.
