    <h2>Mierzwa, The Formal Model of Computer Decomposition of Natural Language
Sentences into Groups of Words for Computer Inference Purposes
(Abstract)</h2>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
     One of the aims of NLP is to inference with knowledge included in
     natural language sentences. To
     enable such a process, a suitable representation of sentences in
     computer memory is required. One of
     the representations, for which an inference process was worked
     out, is a symbolic expression
     representation of natural language sentences. The main element of
     this formalism is splitting
     sentences into groups of words. The work presents a formal method
     of splitting sentences into
     groups of words for inference purposes with symbolic expression
     representation. The method uses
     for grammar representation the Structural Link Grammars
     formalism--SLG introduced by the
     author (based on the Link Grammar). For SLG, the next elements
     were worked out: (1) assigning a
     set of links for each word (based on lexical categories and list
     of features), (2) a method of building a
     graphical representation of processed sentences, (3) an algorithm
     of splitting sentences into groups of
     words based on obtained graphical representation, and (4) a
     realization of English grammar in SLG
     (as an example). This method combines some features of dependency
     grammar and phrase structure
     grammar enabling to write relations between words and groups into
     symbolic expression.
