EC connects adverbs and comparative adjectives: 

            +---Pa---+
            |   +-EC-+
            |   |    |
	It is much bigger

Comparative adjectives have optional EC- connectors conjoined
with their "Pa- or A+".  The same class of adverbs that modify
comparatives - "much", "somewhat", "a little" - can also
modify comparatives like "more", "less", and "fewer": "I like
him much more now", "We have much fewer students now", "I earn
much less now").  Notice that comparatives can be so modified
whether they are acting as adverbs, noun phrases, or
determiners; thus they have EC- optionally conjoined with the
rest of their expression.

ECn is used in noun-focused comparative questions, like
"How much more money do you have". See "<A HREF="section-EE.html">EE</A>h".

ECa is used in adjective-focused comparative questions like
"How much more efficient are they". See "<A HREF="section-EE.html">EE</A>h".

EEx links adverbs to the word "much". Many adverb-modifying
adverbs, like "very", can also modify the word "much". "How"
also has an EEh+ connector; but this connector has special	
significance for post-processing (see "<A HREF="section-EE.html">EE</A>h"). Therefore we
prevent the EEh from linking to "much"; instead, we create
a special "H" connector for this purpose.
