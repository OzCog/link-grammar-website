<b><tt>H</tt></b> connects "how" to "much" or "many". "Much" and "many" can serve
as determiners ("How many books do you have"); they can also
serve as independent noun-phrases ("How many do you have").
Unlike most determiners, they can also be preceded by the word
"how" in either case, creating a question or indirect
question:

<PRE>
         +--H-+-Dmc-+
         |    |     |
	How many books do you have
</PRE>

Therefore they have <tt>H-</tt> connectors, optionally conjoined with
their <tt>D+</tt> connectors and also with their main noun
complexes. However: when the <tt>H-</tt> is being used on "many" and
"much", a question situation is created (direct or
indirect). This introduces constraints on word-order, mainly
relating to subject-verb inversion. For this reason, <tt>H+</tt> on
"how" is conjoined with <tt><A HREF="section-QI.html">QI-</A></tt>
(used in indirect questions) or
<tt><A HREF="section-W.html">Wq-</A></tt> or <tt>Ws-</tt>
(used in direct questions).  These connectors trigger
post-processing rules; see <tt><A HREF="section-SI.html">SI</A></tt>.
<b><tt>H</tt></b> is also in a
post-processing category along with <tt>D##w</tt>, relating also to
s-v inversion; see "<b><tt><A HREF="section-SI.html">SI</A></tt></b>:
Questions without s-v inversion".
