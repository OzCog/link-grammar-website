<tt>TI</tt> is used for titles like "president" and "chairman", which
can be used in certain circumstances without a determiner:
after the preposition "as" or after verbs liked "name" or "elect".

<PRE>
   +--------------CO-------------+
   +--TI--+-Mp---+               |
   |      |      |               |
   As president of the company, it is my decision

             +----TI--+
             |        |
   She was named president of the company
</PRE>

There are special dictionary entries for the no-determiner
usage of these nouns:

<PRE>
  president.i chairman.i: {@M+} & (BI- or (Xd- & Xc+ & MX-) or TI-);
</PRE>

As this expression shows, such nouns can also be complements
of "be" ("<tt>She is president of the company</tt>"), using
<tt><a href="section-BI.html">BI-</a></tt>; and
they can also form comma expressions modifying a noun
("<tt>Jane Smith, president of the company, ...</tt>"), using
<tt><a href="section-MX.html">MX-</a></tt>.
