    <h1>Link Parser Version 4.0 Improvements</h1>

<p>Version 3.0 of the Link Grammar parser was released in August 1998.
Version 4.0, released in August 2000, contains some important changes.
As well as some modest improvements in vocabulary and coverage, there
are these significant new features:

<ol>
<li> The new version has what we call a "phrase-parser": a system which
takes a "linkage" (the usual link grammar
representation of a sentence,
showing links connecting pairs of words) and derives a constituent or
phrase-structure representation, showing conventional phrase
categories
such as noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), prepositional phrase(PP),
clause 
(S), and so on. Click <a href="ph-explanation.html">here</a> for more
information about this. You can also experiment with this feature using
the online version of the parser (click 
<a href="submit-sentence-4.html">here</a>).

<p><li> Another new feature of version 4.0 is "morpho-guessing" of
unknown words.  While earlier versions were able to guess the part of
speech of a word based on its context, the new version also considers
its spelling. For example, words ending in "-ed" are assumed to be
past-tense verbs; words ending in "-ing" are assumed to be present
participles. This greatly improves the ability of the parser to handle
sentences containing multiple unknown words. Click <a
href="morpho-explanation.html">here</a> for more information about
this.

<p><li>The new system features an improved system for handling
punctuation. As in the previous version, punctuation symbols are
"stripped off" of words, in that a space is inserted between the
symbol and a neighboring word. In the new version,
however, the symbols to be stripped off in this way can easily be
specified and modified by the user, using an "affix file" which is
read in by the parser when the program is run. This may also be useful
for other phenomena besides punctuation, particularly for those
designing parsers for other languages. Click <a
href="affix-explanation.html">here</a> for more information about
this. 

<p><li>The new release includes a small system for English-to-German
translation; it also includes a small German dictionary which can be
used for parsing German sentences. Click <a

this.
