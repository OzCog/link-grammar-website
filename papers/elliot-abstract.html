The development of language processing support for the ViSiCAST
project.
(Abstract)</h2>

<p>

ViSiCAST is a major new project funded by the European Union, aiming
to provide improved access to services and facilities for deaf
citizens 
through sign language presented by a virtual human, or avatar. We give
here an outline of the project, and describe early work in the area of 
linguistics and language processing. This work covers two distinct but
related areas: first, the development of an XML-compliant notation for
deaf sign langauge gestures, which can be used to drive the signing
avatar; and, second, the development of a framework supporting the translation
of natural language text into this gesture-orientated notation.
