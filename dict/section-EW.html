<P>
<tt>EW</tt> is used for attaching certain adverbs to question words:

<PRE>
        +--EW-+
        |     |
      about when did it happen ? 
</PRE>
The EW link is used because none of the other adverbial 
modifier links (EA, EE, EN, EZ, etc.) are appropriate for
this situation, and would allow too broad a range of possible
linkages.  Although the <A HREF="section-QI.html">QI</A>
link could fit in this situation, it is meant for forming
indirect questions ("I wonder when it happened?"), and is not
appropriate for such direct questions.
