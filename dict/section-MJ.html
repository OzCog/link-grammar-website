MJ connects prepositions and other post-nominal modifiers 
to the word "and" to create a conjoined prepositional
phrase.

<PRE>
                       +-----Mp----+--------Js-------+
                       |      +MJlj+-MJrj-+    +--Ds-+
                       |      |    |      |    |     |
      it is hidden somewhere in or.j-m near.p the house.n 
</PRE>
In the above example, the <tt>MJ</tt> links join the prepositions
"in" and "near" to the central cordinator "or".  The "or" acts as a 
head-word, connecting as if it were a preposition itself: joining with
an <tt>M</tt> link to the modified noun/adverb on the left, and a 
<tt>J</tt> link to the prepositional object on the right.
</P>
<P>
The subtypes <tt>MJl, MJr</tt>, standing for "left" and "right",
are used to maintain sequential ordering.
The <tt>MJ*j</tt> subtype is used to conjoin individual prepostions,
the <tt>MJ*p</tt> subtype is used to conjoin entire prepositional phrases, and 
the <tt>MJ*a</tt> subtype is used to conjoin post-nominal adjectives.

Thus, for example, the <tt>MJ*p</tt> subtype jopins together the phrases
"in the yard" together with "near the house", to form a single prepositional
phrase that is connected with an <tt>M</tt> link back to the modified adverb:
<PRE>
                       +----------Mp----------+                  
                       |      +------MJlp-----+                  
                       |      +---Js---+      |      +----Js----+
                       |      |  +--Ds-+      +-MJrp-+    +--Ds-+
                       |      |  |     |      |      |    |     |
      it is hidden somewhere in the yard.n or.j-m near.p the house.n 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The <tt>MJ*a</tt> link is used to connect post-nominal adjectival modifiers:
<PRE>
              +-------MXsa-------+-------------Xc-------------+
              |    +------Xd-----+              +---Js---+    |
              |    |     +--MJla-+--MJra--+-MVp-+  +--Ds-+    |
              |    |     |       |        |     |  |     |    |
      the tanker.n , aflame.a and.j-m adrift.a on the ocean.s , soon sank
