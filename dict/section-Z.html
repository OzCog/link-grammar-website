<tt>Z</tt> connects the preposition "as" to certain verbs.

<PRE>
         +-----CO--+
         +--Z--+   |
         |     |   |
	As I said, I like broccoli
</PRE>

Some verbs which take clausal complements - "threaten", "say",
"mention" - can also be used in constructions like the above;
in such cases, the complement requirement of the verb - which
may be mandatory ("<tt>*I said</tt>") - is satisfied.  Such verbs
therefore have "<tt>Z-</tt>" disjoined with their other complement
connectors
(<tt><a href="section-TH.html">TH+</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="section-C.html">Ce+</a></tt>,
etc.). The word "as" has "<tt>Z+</tt>" disjoined
with "<tt><a href="section-C.html">Cs+</a></tt>"
(used in conjunction phrases) and
<tt><a href="section-J.html">J+</a></tt> (used for
prepositional objects). <tt>Z</tt>+ is conjoined with
"<tt>CO+ or MVs-</tt>";
this allows such phrases as closers as well:
"<tt>I like broccoli, as I said</tt>".

<PRE>
  as.p: (Z+ or J+ or Cs+) & (CO+ or MVs-);
</PRE>

The Z link can also be used in comparative expressions:

<PRE>
	He was not as late as I expected
	?He was not as late as I said
</PRE>

"As.z" (the second "as" in a comparative expression) therefore
has <tt>Z+</tt> as well. However, some verbs can be used in this
construction only as openers and closers, not as comparatives
(such as "said" above).  Therefore we subscript the connector
on "as.z" <tt>Zc+</tt>; verbs with can not take <tt>Z</tt>
in comparatives have <tt>Zs-</tt>.
<P>
"As" phrases of this kind can also be used without a subject:

<PRE>
	He likes broccoli, as was expected
	He earns as much as was expected
</PRE>

Here, the phrase "was expected" has two demands: "is" demands
a subject, and "expected" demands a complement.  "As" must
fulfill both of these demands. So "as" has a subject
connector, optionally conjoined with the <tt>Z+</tt>.

<PRE>
   as.z: ({SFsic+} & Zc+

                     +----Z-----+
                     +SF-+--Pv--+
                     |   |      |
   he earns as much as was expected
</PRE>

"Than" may also be used in this way. The use of comparatives
is highly constrained by post-processing:
see "<tt><A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A>:
Comparatives III</tt>".
<P>
The "<tt>Zc</tt>" link here starts a domain, which includes only the
"than" or "as" phrase.  Note also that the subject link here
is an <tt><a href="section-SF.html">SF</a></tt>, not a
<tt><a href="section-S.html">S</a></tt>,
and that it is subscripted.  In
post-processing, we then enforce the same restrictions on the
verbs that may occur with "<tt>SFsic</tt>" that we enforce with the
filler subjects "it" and "there". Thus we allow "...than
seemed to be expected", but prohibit "...than wanted to be
expected", etc.. See
"<tt><A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A>: Filler-it</tt>" for more explanation.
