<P>
<tt>EZ</tt> connects certain adverbs to the word "as", like "almost",
"just", and "about":

<PRE>
              +--EZ-+
              |     |
   I did it almost as quickly as he did
</PRE>

The expression "[number] times" can also be used in this way;
"I did it three times as quickly as he did". The only usage of
"as" that can be modified in this way is the first "as" in a
comparative expression;
"<tt>*I did it as quickly almost as he did"</tt>.
Thus "<tt>EZ-</tt>" only appears on "<tt>as.y</tt>",
which is the dictionary expression for this usage.
