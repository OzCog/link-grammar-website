TD connects day-of-the-week words forward to words like "morning",
"afternoon", and "evening". The day-of-the-week word serves as
the head of the expression, and makes an MV, CO or other
connection to the rest of the sentence. See "<A HREF="section-DT.html">DT</A>" for more
discussion of time expressions.
