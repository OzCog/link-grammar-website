SJ connects nouns to the word "and" to create a conjoined noun
phrase.
The SJ link allows conjoined nouns to appear in almost any situation
where a plain, common noun may appear: thus, typically, as subject,
object or prepositional object.
<PRE>
                +------Spx-----+         
         +--SJ--+--SJ--+       +---Pg---+
         |      |      |       |        |
      Mike.b and.j-n Joe.b went.v-d fishing.v 


                    +-------Ju-------+        
      +--Ss-+--MVp--+       +---SJ---+---SJ--+
      |     |       |       |        |       |
     he wrote.v-d for.p piano.n-u and.j-n flute.s 
</PRE>
In the above examples, the <tt>SJ</tt> links join the two nouns
to the central coordinator "and".  The "and" acts as a head-word,
connecting as if it were a noun itself: in the first case, connecting
with an <tt>S</tt> link to form the subject of the sentence, and with
a <tt>J</tt> link in the second example, to become the prepositional
object.
</P>
<P>
The subtypes <tt>SJl, SJr</tt>, standing for "left" and "right",
are used to maintain sequential ordering; thus, for example:
<PRE>
         +-SJl--+--SJr--+ 
         |      |       | 
      Jack.b and.j-n Jill.f
</PRE>
Ordering is important for parsing comma-conjoined lists:
<PRE>
             +----SJl----+------Spx------+        
         +SJl+SJr-+      +--SJr--+       +---K---+
         |   |    |      |       |       |       |
      Jack.b , Jill.f and.j-n Mike.b fell.v-d down.r 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The <tt>SJ*s</tt> subtype is used to coordinate singular nouns, 
<tt>SJ*p</tt> coordinates plural, and <tt>SJ*u</tt> coordinates
uncountable (mass) nouns. This is used for enforcing number 
agreement in various situations:
<PRE>
      cars and trucks are vehicles
      *cars and trucks is vehicles
      *car and truck are vehicles
</PRE>
