<b><tt>J</tt></b> connects prepositions to their objects.

<PRE>
             +-Mp+----J---+    +-----MVp----+-J-+
             |   |        |    |            |   |
        The man with the hat chased the dog on Tuesday
</PRE>

Proper and common nouns, accusative pronouns, and other words
that can act as noun-phrases have <tt>J-</tt> disjoined with their
<tt><A HREF="section-S.html">S+</A></tt>,
<tt><A HREF="section-SI.html">SI-</A></tt>, and 
<tt><A HREF="section-O.html">O-</A></tt> connectors.

<P>
Prepositions have "<tt>J+ & (Mp- or MVp-)</tt>". <b><tt>Mp</tt></b> is used for
prepositions modifying nouns; <tt>MVp</tt> is used for prepositions
modifying verbs and adjectives.  Prepositions may also have
other connectors, disjoined with <tt>J+</tt>, such as <tt>Mg+</tt>,
<tt>Mv+</tt>, and
<tt>QI+</tt>; see "<b><tt><A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A></tt></b>:
Other Uses of <tt>MVp</tt> and <tt>MVs</tt>".

<h3>Js, Jp, Ju: Singular, plural, uncountable</h3>
The <tt>Js</tt>, <tt>Jp</tt> and <tt>Ju</tt> forms are as described
above, with the subscripts indicating singular, plural or uncountable
(mass noun) attachements.

<h3>Jw: Questions</h3>
<tt>Jw</tt> is used to connect prepositions to noun-phrase
question-words in the construction "To whom were you
speaking?"  The construction formed here is very similar to
that formed for determiner-question-words, as in "To which
person were you speaking?" See "<tt><A
HREF="section-JQ.html">JQ</A></tt>"
for an explanation. <tt>Jw</tt> is
also used in prepositional relative clauses, like "The room IN
WHICH I was working was cold". See "<tt><A
HREF="section-M.html">Mj</A></tt>".

<h3>Jr, Jm, Jy: Relative and comparative clauses</h3>
Regarding <tt>Jr</tt>, see "<tt><A HREF="section-B.html">B</A></tt>: Noun-Modifying Prepositional-Object
Relative Clauses". <tt>Jm</tt> and <tt>Jy</tt> relate to comparatives;
see "<tt><A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A></tt>: Comparatives", sections II
(<tt>Jm</tt>) and VII (<tt>Jy</tt>).

<h3>Jd: Determiners</h3>
<tt>Jd</tt> is used with quantifying or quasi-numeric determiners.  The
resulting linkage forms a loop, together with the 
<tt><A HREF="section-D.html">D</A></tt> link, thus:

<PRE>
               +----------Op---------+
               |         +----Dmc----+
               |   +--Ds-+-OFd-+--Jd-+
               |   |     |     |     |
          I have.v a number.d of cookies.n 
</PRE>
In the above example "a number of" is acting effectively as 
a determiner phrase. Thus, its head word, "number", gets a <tt>D+</tt>
link. Yet, the phrase ends with a preposition that shouldn't dangle,
and so, for this case, a <tt>Jd+</tt> link is also used to complete
the loop.  Plural and mass nouns have a 
<tt>(Jd- &amp; D- &amp; O-)</tt> disjunct on them.

<h3>Jj, Jk: Link-crossing over conjunctions</h3>
<tt>Jj</tt> and <tt>Jk</tt> are used together to violate the graph-planarity
rule, so as to build a fractured link that crosses over a conjunction:

<PRE>
          +-------I-------+
          |     +--VJlpi--+-----------Jk----------+
          |     +-MVp+-Jj-+--VJrpi-+--MVp-+---Js--+
          |     |    |    |        |      |       |
   ...  to.r look.v at and.j-v listen.v to.r everything
</PRE>
Here, the <tt>Jj</tt> and <tt>Jk</tt> should be taken as artificially
forming a single link, that crosses over the conjunction, and indicates
that the prepositional object of "at" is "everything". (Paraphrasing,
"... to look at everything and listen to everything.") In this example,
there is no way to create a single <tt>Js</tt> link from "at" to
"everything" without voilating planarity.  Thus, planarity is maintained
by splitting <tt>Js</tt> into two, with the split being a "hole" or
"jump", allowing limited non-planarity.  Thus, <tt>Jj</tt> and <tt>Jk</tt>
can be thought of as forming a single link, with a "hole" in it, with
that hole being exactly the right shape to hop over the conjunction.
