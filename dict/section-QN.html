<b><tt>QN</tt></b> connects verbs to question-words, in an inverted
fashion:
        
<PRE>
          +-----QN------+
          |             |
    It   happend       when?
    You  hit           how     many home runs?
    You  want          which   one?
    You  know this     how?
    You  hit the car   how?
</PRE>
Almost all verbs can be used in this inverted fashion.
<P>
This link has some similarities to the
<a href="section-QI.html"><tt><b>QI</b></tt> link</a> used for indirect
questions; it should not be confused with it.
