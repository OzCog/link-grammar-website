<tt>YS</tt> connects nouns to the possessive suffix "'s". "'s" 
then acts as a determiner, making a <tt>D</tt> connection to a noun.

<PRE>
          +-YS-+-D-+
	  |    |   |
	Jane  's  dog is black
</PRE>

Plural nouns take only an "'"; "The students' dogs are black".
This uses <tt>YP</tt> rather than <tt>YS</tt>. The dictionary
thus includes the following:

<PRE>
	's: YS- & D+;
	': YP- & D+;
</PRE>

<P>
A possessive pronoun ("Jane's") can also act as a complete
noun phrase: "Jane's is black". Thus the expressions "'s" and
"'" also carry the main expression carried by nouns "<tt>(S+ or O-
etc.)</tt>". This usage is rare, however; we therefore give it a
cost of 2.

<P>
All proper and common singular nouns have <tt>YS+</tt>; all plural
nouns have <tt>YP+</tt>. (<tt>YS</tt> is also used for plural forms
that don't end in 's': "Men's legs are longer than women's". For this
reason it was necessary to create separate dictionary
categories for plural nouns ending in 's' and not ending in
's'.)  Nouns which form possessive determiners in this way -
whether singular or plural - take their own determiners and
adjectives just like ordinary nouns (ex. 1-6 below). However,
they may not take post-modifiers like relative clauses
(ex. 7-8); nor, of course, may they act as subjects or
objects. Thus <tt>YS+</tt> and <tt>YP+</tt> on nouns must be
conjoined with "<tt>@A- & D+</tt>", disjoined with everything else.

<PRE>
	1.The rich student was tall
	2.The rich student's car was black
	3.*Student was tall
	4.*Student's car was black
	5.Students are tall
	6.Students' cars are black
	7.The man I met was tall
	8.*The man I met's car was black
</PRE>

<P>
In a few weird cases, a noun can take both a possessive
determiner and another determiner; these cannot be handled ("A
girls' school" is rejected).
