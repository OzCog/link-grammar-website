<H2>Coordinating Conjunctions</H2>

<P>Earlier versions of the Link Grammar parser (those prior to version 
4.7.0) used a special technique for parsing sentences containing 
conjunctions. This technique proved to have a number of disadvantages,
and was removed in 2014, with version 5.2.0. Problems included:
<ul>
<li>A relatively non-specific way of conjoining parses, which leads to ...
<li>A combinatorial explosion of possible linkages, which results in ...
<li>Poor performance when parsing long, complex sentences.
</ul>
Worse, the technique was encoded purely algorithmically, in C code,
making it (very) hard to modify, expand, or refine. None-the-less, this
was done because the original authors believed that there was no other
way; that the handling of coordinating conjunctions did not fit "naturally"
into the theory of Link Grammar.  The current maintainers believe that
this is not at all the case: that coordinating conjunctions can be handled
quite well within the context of the main theory.  In fact, using ordinary
links to handle conjunctions increases specifity and coverage, allowing
a broader range of sentences to be parsed correctly, while reducing 
combinatorial explosion, and providing a tremendous boost to performance
(quite often, a factor of ten or more for most well-written, "literate"
texts, of the kind that might contain long, complex sentences). What 
follows below is a verbatim copy of the original description of conjunction 
handling. The current technique, introduced in version 4.7.0, is described
<A HREF="coordination.html">here</A>.  The use of the old-style,
"fat" linkages is disabled in versions 4.7.0 through 5.2.0, and the 
code to support it was permanently removed in 2014, in version 5.2.0.
It can be enabled in these older versions by specifying the
<tt>!use-fat=1</tt> flag at the parser prompt, or by calling
<tt>parse_options_set_use_fat_links(TRUE)</tt> from C code.
</P>

<P><B>1.0. THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION OF THE HANDLING OF CONJUNCTIONS.</B> 
Coordination constructions do not fit naturally into the framework
of link grammars.  We have devised a method for automatically
transforming the given link grammar into another one that captures the
desired phenomena. (It involves internally generating special links
for use with conjunctions, which we call "fat links".) This system is
hard-wired in, and cannot easily be modified by the user.  However, it
has proven to be effective in handling the vast majority of uses of
conjunctions.  Our discussion will focus on the word "and", although
the ideas apply to the use of "or", "but", "either-or", "neither-nor",
"both-and", and "not only - but".

<P><B>1.1. THE HANDLING OF CONJUNCTIONS.</B> We begin by proposing a simple
definition of the use of "and" within the framework of link grammars.
Then we'll mention a few problems with the definition, and suggest an
improvement.  The second definition is the one used in our system.  It
has drawbacks, but on balance it has proven to be remarkably
effective.

<P>Given a sequence S of words containing the word "and", a
"well-formed 'and' list" L is a contiguous subsequence of words
satisfying these conditions:

<P>1. There exists a way to divide L into components (called "elements"
of the well-formed "and" list) such that each element is separated
from its neighboring elements by either a comma or the word "and" (or
both).  (The comma and the "and" are not part of the element.)  The
last pair of elements must be separated by "and" (or a comma followed
by "and"). For example, in "The dog, cat, and mouse ran", "dog",
"cat", and "mouse" are the elements of the well-formed "and"
list "dog, cat, and mouse".

<P>2. Each of the sequences of words obtained by replacing L (in S) by
one of the elements of L is a sentence of the link grammar.

<P>3. There is a way of choosing a linkage for each of these sentences
such that the set of links outside of the "and" list elements are
exactly the same in all of the sentences, and the connectors joining the
sentence with its "and" list element are the same.  In other
words, if we cut the links connecting the element to the rest of the
sentence, remove that element from the sentence, and replace it by one
of the other elements, then the cut links can be connected to the
element so as to create a valid linkage.

<P>The sequence S is grammatical if each instance of "and" in it is
part of a well-formed and list. 
 
<P>For example, consider the sentence "We ate popcorn and watched
movies on TV for three days." The the phrase "ate popcorn and
watched movies on TV" is a well-formed "and" list because it can be
divided into elements "ate popcorn" and "watched movies on
TV ", which satisfy all of the conditions above.  The following two
linkages show this.  Note that in both cases the element is attached
to the rest of the sentence with an "S" to the left and an "MV"
to the right.

<PRE>
          +-------------------MVp-------------------+-----Jp-----+     
  +-Wd-+Sp+--Os--+                                  |     +--Dmc-+     
  |    |  |      |                                  |     |      |     
///// we ate popcorn.n                            for.p three days.n  

                              +---------MVp---------+-----Jp-----+  
  +-Wd-+----------Sp----------+---Op---+--Mp-+Js+   |     +--Dmc-+  
  |    |                      |        |     |  |   |     |      |  
///// we                   watched movies.n on TV for.p three days.n
</PRE>

<P>There is a major problem with this definition.  It contains no
requirement that the words of an element of an "and" list be connected
to each other, nor be related in any way (other than being
contiguous).  This allows many clearly ungrammatical sentences to be
accepted, and generates numerous spurious linkages of correct
sentences.  For example, it would imply that "I like the beer John and
wine Harry drank" is a valid sentence.

<P>We have two techniques to limit the set of sentences deemed
grammatical by this rule.  The first is to simply restrict the types
of connectors that can connect the element of the "and" list to the
rest of the sentence. The list of connectors allowed to do this is
contained in the list "ANDABLE-CONNECTORS" in the dictionary. (If a
connector type is included in this list, this means, in effect, that
several of them may be joined to a connector of the opposite type. So,
including "S-" on this list allows "John ran and skipped".) See Section
1.2 for further discussion of "andable connectors". 

<P>The second method is to restrict the definition of a well-formed "and"
list.  Say that a well-formed "and" list is a "strict and list" if it
also satisfies the following condition: Each element must be connected
to the rest of the sentence through exactly one of its words.  (It may
use many connectors.)

<P>This is the system that we have implemented. This logic of dealing
with conjunctions is reflected in the parser's output. A sentence with
conjunctions is outputted showing the sentence split up into several
sub-sentences:

<PRE>
                                  +---J--+
          +--------S----------+-MV+  +-D-+
          |                   |   |  |   |
        John, Dave, and Fred ran in the park

                                  +---J--+
               +---S----------+-MV+  +-D-+
               |              |   |  |   |
        John, Dave, and Fred ran in the park

                                  +---J--+
                          +S--+-MV+  +-D-+
                          |   |   |  |   |
        John, Dave, and Fred ran in the park
</PRE>

<P>Alternatively, the conjunctive linkages can be merged into one in
the display. To use this mode, type "!union". For the above sentence,
"!union" mode yields this:

<PRE>
        +----------Ss----------+              
        |      +-------Ss------+    +---Js--+
        |      |          +-Ss-+-MVp+  +-Ds-+
        |      |          |    |    |  |    |
      John , Dave , and Fred ran.v in the park.n 
</PRE>

In some cases, "!union" mode may result in "crossing" links - the
one situation where this is possible:

<PRE>
       +------Ds------+      
       |    +-------Ss------+
       +-Ds-+         +--Ss-+
       |    |         |     |
      the cat.n and dog.n ran.v 
</PRE>

<P>Of course, several conjunctions may occur in a sentence: "John and
Fred ran and jumped". In such cases, sub-linkages will be generated
for each combination of and-list elements: "John ran, "John jumped",
"Fred ran", and "Fred jumped". Nested "and" structures are also
allowed, like "The people and their sons and daughters were there".
In sentences containing several conjunctions, a large number of
sub-linkages may be generated for a single linkage. For this reason,
it may be preferable to use the "!union" display.

<P>Conjunctions are a frequent source of ambiguity. For example, in
the sentence "Several big cats and dogs with sharp teeth chased me",
"several" may or may not apply to "dogs" (as a plural noun, "dogs"
does not require a determiner); "big" may or may not apply to dogs;
and "with sharp teeth" may or may not apply to cats. Linkages for all
of these possibilities will of course be generated.

<P><B>1.2. USES OF CONJUNCTIONS.</B> The implementation of conjunctions is
"hard-wired" in, and cannot be easily modified.  However, it covers
the vast majority of uses of coordinating conjunctions. First of all,
it allows a wide variety of connector types to be used with
conjunctions. As mentioned above, this is controlled by the connectors
listed in the "ANDABLE-CONNECTORS" list in the dictionary. It can be
seen that most common connector types (both "+" and "-" forms) are
included on the list, permitting a variety of conjunctive expressions.
Here are examples of some of the more commonly used
"andable-connectors":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         John and Fred ran (S+) <BR>
         John ran and jumped (S-) <BR>
         I saw Sue and Mary (O-) <BR>
         I saw and greeted Sue (O+) <BR>
         She left with John and Fred (J-) <BR>
         The dog I saw and chased was black (B-, S-) <BR>
         It was big and black (P-) <BR>
         The dog and the cat I saw were black (B+, R+) <BR>
         She arrived and left on Tuesday (MV-) <BR>
         She did it quickly and efficiently (MV-) <BR>
         The dog and cat ran (D-) <BR>
         I told her that I was coming and that you would be late (TH-)
         <BR>
         What did you tell her and what did she say (Wq-) <BR>
         I left and she followed (Wd-) <BR>
         Sue, a teacher and scholar, is here (MX-, Xc+, Xd-) <BR>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Some connector types are not included on the "andable" list; the
corresponding conjunctive usages are therefore not permitted. Many of
these usages are not exactly ungrammatical, but simply never occur,
like PP+: "?They have and we have gone", G- ("?Fred Smith and Jones
are here" [meaning "Fred Smith and Fred Jones are here]"), ND+ ("?She
left three days or weeks ago"), and EA+ ("?She is very or somewhat
competent"). Others truly seem ungrammatical, like Q+: "*Would or
could you go?".

<P>As well as "and", the system also handles the conjunctions "or",
"but", "either-or", "neither-nor", "both-and", and "not only - but":

<PRE>

 +--------------Sp-------------+          
 +-----Sp----+--Os-+           +--Op---+
 |           |     |           |       |
we          ate popcorn or  watched movies
we either   ate popcorn or  watched movies
we neither  ate popcorn nor watched movies
we both     ate popcorn and watched movies
we          ate popcorn but watched movies           
we not only ate popcorn but watched movies 

</PRE>

<P>All the words involved in conjunctive constructions--"and", "but",
"or", "both", "nor", "either", "neither", "not", and "only"--must be
included in the dictionary. (If such a word is removed, its
conjunctive use will be disabled.) However, such words may also be
given ordinary linkage expressions, and in fact are. These ordinary
usages are considered along with their conjunctive usages. If no
ordinary linkage expression is desired for a word, simply give it a
linkage expression containing a dummy connector of some kind that will
never be used, like "NO+".

<P>A few usages of coordinating conjunctions are handled using
ordinary link logic (this is why there are ordinary connector
expressions for these words in the dictionary).  There is some overlap
between the special ("fat-link") handling of conjunctions and the
ordinary handling, so that some sentences receive multiple parses. For
example, ordinary clauses conjoined together will receive two parses:
"John ran and Fred walked". See the entries in the Guide-To-Links on
"W" and "CC" for discussion these ordinary usages of conjunctions.

<P><B>1.3. SUBSCRIPTS.</B> How should subscripts (on the connector names)
be dealt with?  When two or more connectors with different subscripts
are combined with "and", they may only connect to a connector that may
connect to all of them.  For example, consider the following
dictionary:

<PRE>
a:            Ds+; 
the:          D+;
those:        Dm+;
cats dogs:    Dm-;
cat dog:      Ds-;
</PRE>

<P>Among the determiners above only "the" can grammatically be allowed to
modify the "and" list "cats and dog".  This is because the only
connector which matches Dm- and Ds- is D+, not Ds+ or Dm+. This is the
solution we implement.

<P>There is an exception to be handled here, however. The system we've
described so far would accept "the dog and cat runs", while rejecting
"the dog and cat run".  Both of these judgements are wrong because in
English whenever two singular subjects are "anded" together they
become plural.  We have incorporated this exception: "Ss+" connectors,
when "anded" together, may connect to an "Sp-", but not to an "Ss-".

<P><B>1.4. SOME PROBLEMS.</B> There are a few problems to be
discussed. Some of these are handled by the current system; others are
not.  One problem is sentences like the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        I gave Bob a doll and Mary a gun.  <BR>
        This is a problem Moscow created and failed to solve. <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The former will be rejected since in "I gave Bob a doll", "gave" is
linked to both "Bob" and to "doll".  Thus, "Bob a doll" cannot be an
element of a strict "and" list.  In the second sentence, "Moscow"
needs to connect to "failed" and "problem" must connect to "solve", so
"problems to solve" cannot be an element of a strict "and" list.  This
phenomenon does occur (although rarely) in formal English, so we would
like to solve it.  The problem remains in our current system.

<P>Another problem arises with embedded clauses.  Consider the following
linkage of the sentence "I think John and Dave ran".

<PRE>
           +-S-+--C--+-----S------+
           |   |     |            |
           I think John and Dave ran

                             +-S--+
                             |    |
           I think John and Dave ran
</PRE>

<P>This linkage is a combination of the following two sentences "I
think John ran" and "Dave ran".  This linkage should clearly be
rejected.  (Actually, this linkage would not be found anyway in the
current version, but this is a simple demonstration of the problem.)
Intuitively, the problem with this linkage is that the same "S" link
(the one between "and" and "ran") is being used to mean something that
"I think" ("John ran") and also something that is just a fact ("Dave
ran").  We have devised a system for detecting such patterns, using
post-processing (see section 6).  As mentioned above, we handle
conjunction sentences by expanding the original sentence into several
subsentences.  We then compute the domain structure of the resulting
linkage of each sentence.  Finally, the original linkage is deemed
incorrect if the nesting structure of a pair of links descending from
the same link ("e.g." the "S" links in the two sentences above) do not
have the same domain ancestry (are contained in the same set of
domains). Linkages which are considered incorrect in this way have
the message "inconsistent domains" at the top of the display.

<P>Another problem concerns the different kinds of conjunctions. Right
now, our system does not distinguish between the various kinds of
conjunctions allowed; any of them may be used with any "andable"
connector. However, there appear to be different constraints on
different conjunctions. This results in some false positives:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I saw John and Fred <BR>
*I saw John but Fred <BR>
The dog or cat ran <BR>
*The either dog or cat ran <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A few other smaller problems should be mentioned. Sometimes adverbs are
used with conjunctions:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        He talked to Steve and, apparently, Fred <BR>
        *He talked to, apparently, Fred <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As the second sentence shows, it is the conjunction that makes the
first adverbial use valid. We have no good way of handling this
construction. Secondly, there are some special uses of punctuation
with conjunctions. Sometimes, a comma is inserted both before and
after the final element in an "and" list (ex.1). And sometimes
semi-colons may be used instead of commas, particularly when the
and-list elements themselves contain commas (ex. 2).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        1. John, and Steve, are coming <BR>
        2. John; my advisor, Steve; and several other people are
           coming <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thus our system still needs some work in the area of conjunctions.
