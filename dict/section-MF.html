This unusual construction requires a special arrangement. It
involves a noun-phrase surrounded by commas, consisting of
a phrase like "many [/some/five/several] of them" followed
by a noun phrase. In our handling of this construction, "of_them"
is an idiomatic expression which serves as the head of the phrase.
