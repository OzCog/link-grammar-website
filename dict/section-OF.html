<tt>OF</tt> connects certain verbs and adjectives to the word "of". 

<PRE>
           +---OF---+---J--+
           |        |      |
     I thought     of something
  They accused him of the crime
    I am proud     of     you
</PRE>

In most cases, "of" can not modify verbs: "*I ran of the
house". With a few verbs it can, however, such as "think" and
"accuse". In such cases, "<tt>OF+</tt>" is treated like a complement
connector, disjoined with other connectors like <tt>TO+</tt> and
<tt>TH+</tt>. In some cases, like "accuse", the verb also requires a
direct object preceding the "of" phrase; such verbs carry 
"<tt>(O+ or B-) &amp; {OF+}</tt>. 
In other cases, such as "think", no object is used.  

<P>
"Of" phrases can also modify certain adjectives: "I'm proud of
you". Such adjectives have <tt>OF+</tt> disjoined with their other
complement connectors.

<P>
"Of", of course, is also a regular preposition (although it
can only modify nouns, not verbs). To connect to its object in
sentences like those above, "of" can simply use the same <tt>J</tt>
link used in prepositional phrases. Thus "of" carries 
"<tt>J+ &amp; (OF- or Mp-)</tt>".

<P>
<tt>OF</tt> is also used with gerunds, in cases where the gerund is
being used with a determiner: "His chasing of the dog was
unfortunate". 
See "<tt><A HREF="section-S.html">S</A></tt>: 
Gerunds: The no complement / determiner case". 

<P>
<tt>OFd</tt> is used with quantifying determiner phrases,
such as "a number of". See the
<tt><A HREF="section-J.html">Jd</A></tt> link for an
example and details.
