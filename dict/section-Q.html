<P>
<b><tt>Q</tt></b> is used in questions, to link to auxilliary verbs,
whenever there is s-v inversion (<i>i.e.</i> when there is no preceding
object.) In truth queries, the auxiliary connects to the wall
(ex. 1 below).
In general WH-questions, it connects the question-word (WHEN, WHERE,
WHY, HOW) to the auxilliary (ex. 2).  For locative questions,
it connects the preposition to the auxilliary (ex.3). In this last case,
there is no way to directly join the WH-locator to the auxilliary,
without a link-crossing being forced (in this example, WHICH and
WERE cannot be linked without violating planarity).
<PRE>
         +--Qd-+
         |     |            
       /////  Are you going to to the movie?

         +--W--+-Qw-+
         |     |    |
       /////  Why  did you go?

               +---------Qp-----+ 
               +-----Js----+    |
         +--W--+-JQ-+      |    |
         |     |    |      |    | 
       /////  In  which  room  were you working?
</PRE>

This can be contrasted with noun-focused questions, either of
object-type or subject-type, where the question-word connects
to the verb ("WHAT DID you buy", "WHO BOUGHT that").
In the former case, there is s-v inversion, but no <tt>Q</tt>
connection is made. Thus the <tt>Q-</tt> is optional on auxiliaries.
<P>
Post-processing ensures that when a question-word is used in
object-type or when-where-why questions (but not subject-type
questions), the outer group of the sentence contains some kind
of <tt>SI</tt>; this is because in all such cases, a <tt>Wq</tt>
is used to connect to the wall, and this requires an <tt>SI</tt>
in the same group. Post-processing further ensures that <tt>SI</tt>
links can only be used when a <tt>Wq</tt> is present 
(see "<A HREF="section-SI.html">SI</A>"). However, in simple
yes-no questions, question inversion must occur, yet no
question word is present. Thus the <tt>Q+</tt> on the wall is
subscripted <tt>Qd</tt>, and this is added to <tt>Wq</tt> on
the list of link-types that permit s-v inversion. Similar
considerations apply for the <tt>Qp</tt> link.
<P>
(Note that the <tt>Q-</tt> on auxiliaries is conjoined with <tt>SI+</tt>,
but disjoined with <tt>S-</tt>; by link logic, it can only be used with
<tt>SI+</tt>. Post-processing tightly constrains the use of <tt>SI</tt>,
preventing it from occurring in indirect questions, relative clauses,
<i>etc.</i>; the use of <tt>Q</tt> is thus automatically constrained as
well.)
<P>

<h3><tt>Qd</tt>: Truth query, Conditionals</h3>
<P>
The <tt>Qd</tt> link, because it connects to auxilliaries,
effectively indicates a truth-query.
<PRE>
            +------------Xp------------+
            +-------->WV------->+      |
            |        +----I*d---+      |
            +-->Qd---+-SIp-+    +-Osm+ |
            |        |     |    |    | |
        LEFT-WALL did.v-d you see.v it ?

            +--------------Xp--------------+
            |        +---Paf---+           |
            +-->Qd---+-SIs-+   +--MVp-+    |
            |        |     |   |      |    |
        LEFT-WALL was.v-d it fun.a there.r ?
</PRE>

It is also used in conditional constructions: specifically,
post-posed conditionals with subject-verb inversion:
<PRE>
    +------------------->WV------------------------>+
    +------------->Qd-------------------+           |
    |                      +-----Iqj----+----PP-----+
    |               +--PP--+-Ox-+  +-Xd-+-SI--+     |
    |               |      |    |  |    |     |     |           
LEFT-WALL I would have   seen  you ,   had   you   been there
          I would have   done that ,   had   you   come with me
</PRE>


<h3><tt>Qw</tt>: WH-aux linking</h3>
<P>
The <tt>Qw</tt> link is used to connect WH-words to auxilliaries.
This allows the primary verb to be marked as a head-verb (via the
<tt><A HREF="section-WV.html">WV</A></tt> connector), the auxilliary
marked with <tt>(Qw- & <A HREF="section-I.html">I+</A>)</tt>, thus
forming a cycle closed by the <tt><A HREF="section-W.html">W</A></tt>
connector between the WH-word and the wall.
<PRE>
            +--------------Xp-------------+
            +---------->WV----------->+   |
            |              +-----I----+   |
            +-->Wq--+--Qw--+-SIp+     |   |
            |       |      |    |     |   |
        LEFT-WALL when  will.v you come.v ?
        LEFT-WALL where will.v you  go.v  ?
</PRE>
<P>
<h3><tt>Qp</tt>: Prep-what/which-aux linking</h3>
<P>
The <tt>Qp</tt> link is used when a truth query (<tt>Qd</tt> link)
has been converted into a WH-query by a preposed preposition:
<PRE>
            +--------------------Xp-------------------+
            +---------------->WV---------------->+    |
            |      +--------Qp-------+           |    |
            |      +----Js---+       +-----I-----+    |
            +->Wj--+-JQ+Ds**c+       +-SIp+      |    |
            |      |   |     |       |    |      |    |
        LEFT-WALL by what means.s will.v you arrive.v ?
</PRE>
Ideally, there would also be a link between the WH-word and the
auxilliary; but this is not possible in this case, as a link-crossing
would be forced.
<P>
The <tt>Qp</tt> link also works when the auxilliary verb is elided:
<PRE>
            +---------------Xp--------------+
            +------------>WV----------->+   |
            |       +---------Qp--------+   |
            |       +-----Js-----+      |   |
            +-->Wj--+--JQ-+--D---+      |   |
            |       |     |      |      |   |
        LEFT-WALL  By   what   means  ....v ?
        LEFT-WALL  For  what  reason  ....v ?
        LEFT-WALL  To   what    end   ....v ?
        LEFT-WALL  In   which   way   ....v ?
</PRE>

Other examples include:
"IN which room WERE you working", "TO whom WERE you speaking".
See <tt><A HREF="section-JQ.html">JQ</A></tt> and
<tt><A HREF="section-J.html">J</A></tt> for details.

<h3><tt>Qe</tt>: Adverbial questions</h3>
<P>
<tt>Qe</tt> is used to connect adverbs to following auxiliaries
in adverbial questions:

<PRE>

                     +---I---+
         +EEh-+--Qe--+-SI+   |
         |    |      |   |   |
        How quickly did you run

</PRE>
<tt>Qe</tt> can only be used in questions ("*Very quickly did you
run").  This is enforced by the fact that the sentence must
connect to the wall, and can only do so through "how". Again,
the use of <tt>Qe</tt> in indirect questions is prevented because
<tt>Q-</tt> on auxiliaries is conjoined with SI, whose use is
constrained by post-processing.

<P>
One false positive must be addressed here, however:

<PRE>
         +------------B-------+
         |           +----I---+
         |    +--Qe--+-SI-+   |
         |    |      |    |   |
      * Who quickly did Jane hit

</PRE>
We prohibit this in post-processing by requiring that a group
containing a <tt>Qe</tt> must contain an <tt>EEh</tt> - a link-type
occurring only on the word "how".

<h3><tt>Qa</tt>: Why-action questions</h3>
<P>
<tt>Qa</tt> is used to connect the question "why?" to action verbs:

<PRE>
          +---->WV--->+
          +->Wv--+-Qa-+-MVp-+
          |      |    |     |
      LEFT-WALL why run.v away ?
</PRE>
