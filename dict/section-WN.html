<tt>WN</tt> is used to connect "when" phrases back to time-nouns like "year"
and "day". In such cases, <tt>WN</tt> is acting like a noun-modifier;
such modifiers would normally use <tt>M-</tt>. However, "when" cannot
normally be used in this way, as the second sentence shows;
only with time nouns. Thus time-nouns have an option <tt>WN+</tt>
(along with an optional <tt>@M+</tt>); "when" has <tt>WN-</tt>
conjoined with <tt>Cs+</tt>, connecting to a subordinate clause.
