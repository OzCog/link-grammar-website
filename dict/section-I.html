<tt>I</tt> connects certain verbs with infinitives.
<PRE>
                                         +---I----+
        +-S-+--I-+                    +S-+-O--+   |
        |   |    |                    |  |    |   |
        I must  go to the store       I made him  go

</PRE>
Infinitive verb forms have "<tt>I-</tt>", conjoined with their
complement connectors. In every case except "be", the
infinitive form is the same as the plural form; therefore the
same expression can be used. Plural-infinitive forms thus
carry "<tt>(Ss- or I- or Wi-) & [complement]</tt>". (The
<tt>Wi-</tt> is used to connect to the wall in imperative
constructions.)

<P>
Modal verbs - "will", "may", "can", and the like - have <tt>I+</tt>
connectors; certain other verbs do as well, such as "do" and
"help". Some verbs have <tt>I+</tt> conjoined with <tt>O+</tt>,
like "make" and "see", allowing an object followed by an infinitive.
In these latter cases, the infinitive verb relates to the direct
object of the main verb; it is similar in this respect to
object+infinitive constructions like "I want him to go". Thus
it is appropriate to include the <tt>O</tt> and <tt>I</tt> link
in their own domain. For this reason, we label the <tt>I+</tt>
connector on such verbs as "<tt>I*j+</tt>", and make this an
"urfl-domain"-starting link, including both the <tt>O</tt> and
the <tt>I*j</tt>. (See "<tt><A HREF="section-TO.html">TO</A>o</tt>".)

<P>
The word "to" also has an "<tt>I+</tt>", conjoined with "<tt>TO-</tt>",
used in "to+infinitive" constructions.

<P>
Modal verbs are almost always used with an infinitive.
However, occasionally the infinitive is omitted: "If you
cannot do it, you should find someone who can". For this
reason, modals are given "<tt>S- & (I+ or [[()]])</tt>";
this allows them to make no connection to an infinitive,
with a cost of 2. "Do" is similar in this respect.

<H3>I*a: Indirect questions</H3>
"<tt>I*a</tt>" is used in object-type infinitival indirect questions.
Here, a "to"+infinitive construction occurs, but in this case
- unlike other "to"+infinitive constructions - the "to" is
unable to connect back to another word.

<PRE>
                   +--Bsw--+
                   |   +I*a+
                   |   |   |
        I wonder what to  buy
</PRE>

<P>
Post-processing insures that <tt>I*a</tt> is only used in the same group
as a <tt>B*w</tt> or <tt>B*m</tt>, thus preventing unwanted uses of this
connector.

<P>
In infinitival indirect questions with "where/when/how" - "I
wonder where to go" - the question word instead makes a <tt>TOn</tt>
connection with "to". See
"<tt><A HREF="section-TO.html">TO</A></tt>: Other kinds of TO connectors".

<H3>I*d: bare infinitives after auxilliary do/did</H3>
"<tt>I*d</tt>" is used for infinitives following "do".

<PRE>
             +--I*d-+-Ox-+
             |      |    |
          I did    see  him yesterday
</PRE>

<H3>I*g: Come/go serial verbs</H3>
"<tt>I*g</tt>" is used for bare infinitives following "come" or "go".

<PRE>
             +--I*g-+-MVp-+-J-+
             |      |     |   |
            come  walk  with  me
</PRE>

<H3>I*j: Serial verbs with interposed objects</H3>
"<tt>I*j</tt>" is used for serial verbs with interposed objects.

<PRE>
                          +----I*j---+
                  +---I---+-Ox-+     |
                  |       |    |     |
           you should   hear  him  sing
</PRE>

<H3>If: Filler-it</H3>
"<tt>If</tt>" connectors are used by post-processing to enforce the
correct use of "filler-it" and "there". See
"<tt><A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A></tt>: Filler-it".

<H3>Iq: Praphrasing questions</H3>
"<tt>Iq</tt>" connectors are used to connect to paraphrasing questions.
<PRE>
                          +--Iqv--+---I*d---+
                  +--Ss*q-+  +-Xd-+-SIs-+   +Osm+
                  |       |  |    |     |   |   |
     the big question.n is.v , did.v-d he do.v it ?
</PRE>
