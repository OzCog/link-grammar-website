<P>
<tt>C</tt> connects subordinating conjunctions and certain verbs and
adjectives with subjects of clauses.  It is therefore used
only in embedded and subordinate clauses, not main clauses.
The <A HREF="section-CV.html"><tt>CV</tt> link</A> plays an analogous role,
except that it connects to the main verb of the clause.  Thus,
the <tt>C</tt> link always forms a cycle with the <tt>CV</tt> link. See
<tt><A HREF="section-CV.html">CV</A></tt> for more details.
</P>
<PRE>
            +---C--+                          +-C-+
            |      |                          |   |
	I told him I was angry      Call me when you are ready
</PRE>

Every noun, nominative pronoun, and every other potential
subject has a <tt>C-</tt> conjoined with its <tt>S+</tt> connector
(but not its <tt>O-</tt>, <tt>J-</tt>, etc.). The <tt>C-</tt> is
directly disjoined with a <tt>Wd-</tt>,
which is used in main clauses, and <tt>R-</tt>, used in certain
relative clauses:

<PRE>
	dog: ({C- or Wd- or R-} &amp; S+) or O- or J-...
</PRE>

<P>
When a dependent clause is begun, the subject usually makes a
<tt>C</tt> connection to the left. There are two exceptions.  When an
object-type relative clause occurs with an omitted relative
pronoun (<tt>The man you met is here</tt>), the subject of the
relative clause makes an <tt>R-</tt> connection, not a <tt>C-</tt> connection.
The reason for this concerns the use of 
<tt>CO</tt>: see <tt><A HREF="section-CO.html">CO</A></tt>.
Secondly, in indirect object-type questions, the subject of
the indirect-question clause makes no left connection at
all. The <tt>(C- or Wd- or R-)</tt> complex on nouns must therefore
be optional.
</P>

<H3>Different kinds of C+</H3> 
<P>
Ce is used for verbs that take clausal complements, also known
as <tt>embedded clauses</tt>: <tt>tell</tt>, <tt>assume</tt>, <tt>think</tt>, etc.. Such
verbs therefore have <tt>Ce+</tt> disjoined with their other
complement connectors (<tt>TH+</tt>, <tt>TO+</tt>, <tt>O+</tt>, etc.). <tt>TH+</tt> connects to
the word <tt>that</tt> which then connects to an embedded clause. All
verbs that carry <tt>Ce+</tt> also carry <tt>TH+</tt>: <tt>I assumed we would
go</tt>, <tt>I assumed that we would go</tt>. The reverse is not true,
however: <tt>I asserted/whispered/retorted that we should go</tt>;
<tt>*I asserted/whispered/retorted we should go</tt>.
</P>
<P>
Many adjectives which take embedded clauses as complements
also carry <tt>Ce+</tt>. Again, some require <tt>that</tt>, and therefore
carry <tt>TH+</tt>, but some do not: <tt>I am glad you are here</tt>. A very
few nouns also take Ce+, like <tt>day</tt> and <tt>way</tt>: <tt>I still
remember the day I saw him</tt>, <tt>I like the way you do
that</tt>. Most nouns taking clauses require <tt>that</tt>, however.
</P>
<P>
<tt>Cs</tt> is used in several kinds of subordinate clauses. It is used
with certain conjunctions, like <tt>when</tt> and <tt>after</tt>: <tt>The man I
saw after I left your party is here.</tt> (Some other conjunctions
do not take <tt>Cs</tt>; see <tt><A HREF="section-W.html">W</A></tt>.) Usually conjunctions
that take <tt>Cs+</tt>
can either precede or follow the clause they modify (<tt>When I
saw you, I left</tt>; <tt>I left when I saw you</tt>. They thus take <tt>Cs+
& (MVs- or CO+)</tt>.
</P>
<P>

In many cases, such conjunctions may also take noun-phrases or
participles as objects: <tt>The man I saw ( after lunch / after
running ) is here</tt>; thus they have <tt>Cs+ or J+ or Mv+ or Mg+</tt>,
as appropriate. Some conjunctions that take nouns as objects
can modify nouns also: <tt>The party after the lecture was
good</tt>. In this sense, they are essentially acting as
prepositions, and take <tt>Mp-</tt>. This raises the question of
whether they can take <tt>Mp-</tt> and <tt>Cs+</tt> in conjunction: <tt>?The party
after Fred graduated was excellent</tt>.  We allow this, but the
expressions could easily be rewritten to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
Cs is also used for certain nouns that take clausal
complements, like <tt>way</tt> and <tt>time</tt>: <tt>I remember the time I
went to London</tt>. Such nouns therefore have <tt>Cs+ or @M+....</tt>,
conjoined with their main <tt>S+ or O+...</tt> complex. <tt>Cs</tt> is also
used in where/when/how indirect questions: <tt>I wonder where
they will live</tt>.  Such question words therefore have <tt>QI- &amp;
Cs+</tt>. (In direct questions of this kind, s-v inversion must
take place; therefore no <tt>C</tt> connection is made. See
<i><A HREF="section-W.html">W</A>: Questions</i>.)
</P>

<H3>Reasons for the C+ distinctions</H3>
<P>
The reason for making the distinction between <tt>Ce</tt> and <tt>Cs</tt>
relates to <tt>bounded domains</tt>. In relative clauses and
questions (direct and indirect), a transitive verb can make a
B connection to a preceding noun-phrase; however, there are
constraints on how this may be done.  A B link may be made to
a word within an embedded clause (<tt>I wonder who Joe thinks
Bill hit</tt>), but not to a word within a subordinate clause (<tt>*I
wonder who Joe cried when Bill hit.</tt>), nor to a word within a
relative clause or indirect question. To enforce this, <tt>Ce</tt>
connectors (found in embedded clauses) start 'e' domains, <tt>Cs</tt>
connectors (found in conjunction-linked subordinate clauses,
and some indirect questions) start 's' domains; we then
dictate that <tt>B</tt> links can extend out of 'e' domains, but not
's' domains. See 
<i><A HREF="section-B.html">B</A>: B links involving dependent clauses</i> for
further explanation.
</P>
<P>
A <tt>B</tt> link may not be made to a word within a subordinate
clause, from outside that clause. However, it is perfectly fine to
have a conjunction-connected subordinate clause within a relative
clause, as long as the B link is not inside it:
</P>
<PRE>
	*The man I cried when John hit is here
	The man I hit when John cried is here
</PRE>

<H3>Other kinds of C links</H3>
<P>
<tt>Ca</tt> is used in indirect adverbial questions:
</P>
                   
<PRE>
             +-QI-+--EEh-+--Ca-+
             |    |      |     |
	I wonder how quickly Jane ran
</PRE>

<P>
Adverbs that can be used in this way have <tt>EEh- &amp; (Ca+ or
Qe+ or MVa-...)</tt>. (<tt>Qe</tt> is used in direct adverbial questions.)
<tt>Ca</tt> can only be used in indirect questions. This is enforced
because if the sentence must connect to the wall, and can only
do so through <tt>how</tt>. (<tt>How</tt> could make a direct <tt>W</tt> connection	
to the wall, but this would trigger post-processing constraints
which would prevent <tt>Ca</tt> from being used.) Like <tt>Cs</tt> connectors 
(used in other indirect questions), <tt>Ca</tt> starts an 's' domain,
thus putting the indirect question clause in its own group.
</P>
<P>
<tt>Cc</tt> is used with comparatives. See
<i><A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A>: Comparatives V</i>.
</P>
<P>
<tt>Ci</tt> is used on verbs or adjectives taking subordinate clauses
in cases where <tt>filler-it</tt> is required as the subject. See
<i><A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A>: filler-it</i>.
In other respects, <tt>Ci</tt> is similar to <tt>Ce</tt>, and
starts an unbounded <tt>e</tt> domain.
</P>
<P>

<PRE>
      +SFsi+--Paf--+-Ci-+              
      |    |       |    |              
     it   is well-known I was angry 
</PRE>

<P>
<tt>Cr</tt> is used only in one rather obscure construction.
See <i><A HREF="section-B.html">B</A>:
Noun-Modifying Prepositional-Object Relative Clausess</i>.
</P>
<P>
<tt>Ct</tt> and <tt>Cta</tt>  are used with comparatives so that 'than' links to the
relative clause:
</P>

<PRE>
                    +----AFd---+  
             +-MVta-+-Cta-+-Ss-+  
             |      |     |    |  
   John is bigger than  Dave  is  

                             +----Bc---+    
                             +-Ct-+-Ss-+    
                             |    |    |    
   John wants more cookies than Dave wants . 
</PRE>
<P>
<tt>Rw</tt> is used similarly to <tt>Ct</tt>, <tt>Cta</tt>, and <tt>Rn</tt> to link question words to the
relative clauses that follow them.
