<b><tt>QI</tt></b> connects certain verbs and adjectives to
question-words, forming indirect questions:

<PRE>
               +--QI--+
               |      |
        1. I wonder what book he will read            
        2. I wonder what will happen
        3. I wonder what he will do
        4. I wonder when he will come
        5. I wonder how big it is

                       +--QI--+
                       |      |
        6. I am not certain where he is
</PRE>
Question-words thus have <tt>(QI- or W-)</tt>. (The 
<tt><A HREF="section-W.html">W-</A></tt> is used in direct questions,
to attach to the wall.) This is conjoined with various connectors.
Determiner question-words, like ex. 1 above, use
<tt><A HREF="section-D.html">D**w+</A></tt>; subject-type questions (ex.2) use
<tt><A HREF="section-S.html">Ss*w+</A></tt>; object-type questions (ex.3) use
<tt><A HREF="section-B.html">B*w+</A></tt>; where/when/how questions (ex.4) use 
<tt><A HREF="section-C.html">Cs+</A></tt>, 
<tt><A HREF="section-PF.html">PF+</A></tt> or 
<tt><A HREF="section-TO.html">TOn+</A></tt>; adjective questions (ex.5) use 
<tt><A HREF="section-EA.html">EAh+</A></tt>.
See entries for these individual link-types.
<P>
Verbs ("wonder", "know", "ask") and adjectives ("certain",
"clear") that take indirect questions have <tt>QI+</tt>, disjoined with
other complement connectors.
<P>
Do not confuse this link with the
<A HREF="section-QN.html"><tt><b>QN</b></tt> link</A>, which resembles
this link in some ways; <tt><b>QN</b></tt> is used for inverted
questions, such as
<PRE>
           +--QN--+
           |      |
    It happened when?
</PRE>
Such inverted questions can be formed with almost any verb; whereas
indirect questions are fronted by a very limitedset of verbs.
<P>
<b><tt>QIi</tt></b> is used by post-processing to enforce the correct use of
"filler-it".  Certain phrases can only be used with "it" as
the subject ("It is not clear what will happen"; *"I am not
clear what will happen"); this is enforced in
post-processing. <b><tt>QIi</tt></b> is therefore directly analagous to
<tt>THi</tt>
(see "<b><tt><A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A></tt></b>: filler-it").
<P>
<b><tt>QI#d</tt></b> is, similarly, used by post-processing. The issue here is
whether or not the <tt>QI</tt> link should begin a domain. In all
indirect questions, it is clear that the indirect question
should be in a different group from what precedes.  With
"where/when/how" constructions ("I wonder when he will come");
the question-word makes a <tt>Cs</tt> connection to the new subject,
beginning an <tt>'s'</tt> domain; thus the <tt>QI</tt> link need not start a
domain itself. In all other cases, however, the links
extending to the right of the question-word (<tt>B</tt>, <tt>S</tt>,
<tt>D</tt>, <i>etc.</i>)
are not normally domain-starting. In these cases, then, the <tt>QI</tt>
link has to start the domain. Thus we make <tt>QI#d+</tt> a
domain-starting link, and assign it to question-words like
"what" and "who"; "where", "when" and "how" have the
non-domain-starting <tt>QI+</tt>.
