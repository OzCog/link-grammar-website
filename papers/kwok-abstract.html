Scaling question answering to the Web.
(Abstract)</h2>

<p>
The wealth of information on the web makes it an attractive resource
for seeking quick answers to simple, factual questions such as "who
was the first American in space?" or "what is the second tallest
mountain in the world?" Yet today's most advanced web search services
(e.g., Google and AskJeeves) make it surprisingly tedious to locate
answers to such questions. In this paper, we extend question-answering
techniques, first studied in the information retrieval literature, to
the web and experimentally evaluate their performance.  First we
introduce Mulder, which we believe to be the first general-purpose,
fully-automated question- answering system available on the
web. Second, we describe Mulder's architecture, which relies on
multiple search-engine queries, natural-language parsing, and a novel
voting procedure to yield reliable answers coupled with high
recall. Finally, we compare Mulder's performance to that of Google and
AskJeeves on questions drawn from the TREC-8 question track. We find
that Mulder's recall is more than a factor of three higher than that
of AskJeeves. In addition, we find that Google requires 6.6 times as
much user effort to achieve the same level of recall as Mulder.
