<h2>Obsolete!</h2>
This connector was removed in version 5.3.10. It has been replaced by
the <tt><A HREF="section-VC.html">VC</A></tt> link, which links verbs
to the subsequent coordinating conjunctions.  The reason for this
removal is that the long CC link (see examples below) blocks the
connection of the head-verb to the wall (via the
<tt><A HREF="section-WV.html">WV</A></tt> link).  
Coordination can be acheived with the
<tt><A HREF="section-VC.html">VC</A></tt>, which connects to the
previous verb, and with the
<tt><A HREF="section-X.html">Xx</A></tt> link, which connects to the
wall.  Unlike the <tt>CC</tt> link, neither of these links block the
verb-wall connection.
<PRE>
CC is used mainly to connect clauses to coordinating conjunctions. 

          +--------------CC-----------+
          +--S--+--MV--+-C-+-S-+      +-W---+--S--+
          |     |      |   |   |      |     |     |
        John screamed when I arrived but   Sue   left                 

CC is used with coordinating conjunctions only, and it links
to the subject of the previous main clause. Subordinating
conjunctions, by contrast (like "when" and "after"), link to
the main verb of the previous clause, main or dependent. See
"<A HREF="section-W.html">W</A>: Coordinating Conjunctions"; and also the
<A HREF="coordination.html">coordination overview</A>.

Another use of CC is in conditional constructions like this
one. 

      +----------CCq---------+-SI-+
      |                      |    |
      I would have seen you, had you been there                                     
      I would do it,        were it possible

Here, CCq is used. Instead of linking to the subject of the
following clause, the CCq links to a following auxiliary
(either "had" or "were"), which is then forced to use an
"SI*j+", creating subject-verb inversion.  Conditional
expressions can also be used as openers in this way: "Had you
been there, I would have seen you". For this, COp is used. For
this purpose, "had" and "were" have a special "SI*j+ & (CCq-
or COp+)" expression.
