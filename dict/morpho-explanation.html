<H2>Morpho-Guessing</H2>
<P>

<P>A new feature of version 4.0 is "morpho-guessing" of unknown words.
While the old version was able to guess the part of speech of a word
based on its context, the new version also considers its
spelling. Words that end in "-s" are assumed to be plural nouns or
singular verbs; those ending in "-ed", past-tense (or passive) verbs;
those ending in "-ing", present participles; those ending in "-ly",
adjectives. This greatly improves the ability of the parser to handle
sentences containing multiple unknown words. Words that have been
treated in this way are marked with a "[!]". (The parser's old system
of "unknown words" is still in place, for handling words whose
spelling does not match any of the categories listed above; as before,
these are marked with a "[?]".)

<P>For example, consider the sentence
<PRE>
        Overhyped megamergers underperform horrifically
</PRE>

<P>None of these four words are in the parser's dictionary. Without
morphoguessing, the parser would have no way of deciding between many
possible interpretations. With morphoguessing, however, the parser is
able to correctly identify the first as an passive verb form (used
here as an adjective), the second as a noun, and the last as an
adverb; from context, it is then able to guess that the third is a
verb.

<PRE>
            +-------A-------+-------Sp-------+-------MVa-------+
            |               |                |                 |
     overhyped[!].v megamergers[!].n underperform[?].v   horrifically[!].e 

     (S (NP overhyped megamergers)
            (VP underperform
                (ADVP horrifically)))
</PRE>

<P>(Given the same words in a different order--"overhyped megamergers
horrifically underperform"--it can be seen that they are still
correctly identified.)

<P>Morpho-guessing is controlled by a sequence of regular expressions,
specified in the file <tt>4.0.regex</tt>. This allows for rather
fine-grained guessing: thus for example, the current file includes 
rules for guessing Latin nouns and adjectives, as these occur
ffrequently in biology texts, as well as rules for common
chemical names, as they would appear in (bio-)chemistry texts.

<h2>Spell guessing</h2>
<P>In addition, recent versions of link-grammar include an optional
spelling checker. If enabled, and an unknown word is encountered,
the spelling checker will be consulted for alternative spellings.
The use of the spelling checker can be toggled on and off with the
flag <tt>!spell</tt>; use the flag <tt>!vars</tt> to see a listing
of all variables, as well as the current value of each.

<P>
Thus, for example:
