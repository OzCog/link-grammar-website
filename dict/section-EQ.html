<p>
<tt>EQ</tt> is used in parsing equations embedded in scientific text:
</p>

<PRE>
                                +-----MVa-----+        
                                |     +---Xd--+---Xc--+
            +----Ss----+---Pvf--+     |   +-EQ+-EQ-+  |
            |          |        |     |   |   |    |  |
     Phosphorylation was.v observed.v ( P.eq =.v 0.06 ) 
</PRE>

<p>
The equals sign is marked as =.v because it behaves in a verb-like
manner ("the probability is 0.06"). It is also taken to be the
expression head, and is the point from which the equation connects 
to the "outside world", using 
<tt><a href="section-MX.html">MX-</a></tt> or
<tt><a href="section-MV.html">MVa-</a></tt> links.
</p>
<p>
Expression parsing is fairly constrained and weak: equations must 
appear within parenthesis. Single letters and numbers can appear
in equations, as well as nouns, which are treated as "subjects" or
"objects". The <tt>EQ</tt> link is used only in these parenthetical
equations; in free text, equals signs, less-than and greater-than
signs, and similar are treated as synonnyms for the verb "is". In
the example below, the <tt><a href="section-CV.html">CV</a></tt> link
connects to the head verb of the dependent clause, in this case, the
equals sign.

                 +----CV---+   
        +---TH---+-Cet-+-Ss+Op+
        |        |     |   |  |
    I think    that   x.n =.v 4

<p>
This is similar to how colons are treated:

       +-----------------WV----------------+       
       +------Wd------+---------Ss---------+       
       |              |                    +--Osm-+
       |              |                    |      |
