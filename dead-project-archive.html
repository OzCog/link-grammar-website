<h2>Archive of Obsolete Projects that used Link Grammar</h2>
<hr />

Perhaps of historical interest!
<P>
The below is an ad-hoc listing of old announcements and listings
of obsolete projects and dead website links. All of these made use
of Link Grammar in some way, but went stale & obsolete for various
reasons. In some cases, the code was merged into the main LG distro.
In other cases, it was simply abandoned.

<h3>Stanford Parser Compatibility</h3>
<p>A sibling project, <a href="https://wiki.opencog.org/w/RelEx">RelEx</a>,
uses constraint-grammar-like techniques to extract dependency relations
that are compatible with the
<a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml">
Stanford parser</a>. It's performance is comparable to the Stanford
PCFG parsing model, and is more than three times faster than the
Stanford "lexicalized" (factored) model.
</p>
<p>
The RelEx project is no longer in active development. We learned (the hard
way) that the native Link Grammar parses contain much more information
than the Stanford dependency markup is capable of supporting. The
Stanford-style dependencies are simply are not rich or sophisticated enough
to produce the kind of data needed for semantic analysis and comprehension,
viz. tasks such as predicate-argument extraction, framing, semantic selection,
and the like.
</p>

<h3>Language generation</h3>
<p>For sentence generation, i.e. the creation of grammatically correct
sentences from a bag of semantic relations, the
<a href="https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Microplanner">
microplanner</a> and
<a href="https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Surface_Realization_(SuReal)">
surface realization (sureal)</a> portion of OpenCog is strongly recommended.
A short example is
<a href="https://github.com/opencog/opencog/blob/master/examples/sureal/basic.scm">here</a>.
These "sort-of work", but not very well.  The primary issue is that they
do not make use of the statistical information available in language to
choose likely or reasonable sentence constructions.
</p>

<p>We previously recommended two projects that should now be considered
obsolete: NLGen and NLGen2. For your entertainment, they're still listed
below: The <a href="https://launchpad.net/nlgen">NLGen</a>
and <a href="https://launchpad.net/nlgen2">NLGen2</a> projects
provide natural language generation modules, based on, and compatible
with link-grammar and RelEx. They implement the
<a href="https://wiki.opencog.org/w/SegSim">SegSim</a> ideas for NL
generation.

<P>
See the following YouTube videos of a virtual dog,
showing some of NLGen's capabilities (circa 2009):

<h3>Assorted Obsolete projects</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>Delphi bindings</b></dt>
<dd>Delphi (Pascal) is a popular development environment for Windows.
    The
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111013120024/http://www.lakraven.com/delphi-stuff/link-grammar-parser/">LaKraven
    Page</a> provides the source for Delphi bindings, as well as
    pre-compiled DLL's for Windows.
    <p>
    The lakraven website went off-line sometime in 2012 or 2013 ...
    </dd>

<dt><b>Alternative Java bindings</b></dt>
<dd>Another, completely different set of Java bindings have been
    developed: a
    <a href="http://www.chrisjordan.ca/~cjordan/code/LGInterface.tar.gz">tar
    ball is here</a>. These are for the old version 4.1 only.
    Note that these are not compatible with the bindings that ship, by
    default, with the main link-grammar package.
    <p>
    Out of date since 2006 ...
    </dd>

<dt><b>Javascript</b></dt>
<dd>Obsolete Javascript bindings can be found at the
    <a href="https://github.com/dijs/link-grammar/">dijs/link-grammar</a>
    github page. Someone, please port these to the latest version!
    <p>
    Mergeed into mainline Link Grammar. Now part of version 5.8.0
    </dd>

<dt><b>Pre-parsed Wikipedia</b></dt>
<dd>Parsed versions of various texts, including all articles from a
    May 2008 dump of Wikipedia, as well as a partial parse of an October
    2010 dump, are available at
    <a href="https://gnucash.org/linas/nlp/data/">https://gnucash.org/linas/nlp/data/</a>
    <p>
    Deprecated.
    </dd>

<dt><b>English dictionary extensions</b></dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.eturner.net/linkgrammar-wn/">LinkGrammar-WN</a>
     is a lexicon expansion for the English language Link Grammar Parser.
     This project adds 14K new words to the dictionaries. The extended
     lexicon is provided under the GPL license, and thus cannot be
     merged back into the current project.  <b>NOTE:</b> these
     extensions are rather old, and it is likely that they are no longer
     compatible with current link-grammar versions.
     Deprecated
    </dd>

<dt><b>Medical Text Analysis</b></dt>
<dd>The <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/projects/text/">
    MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)
    Clinical Decision Making Group</a>
    has done work to extend the Link Grammar dictionaries by adding
    many new words. All but the six largest of these dictionaries
    have been merged into link-grammar, since version 4.3.1 (January
    2008). The
    large dictionaries EXTRA.2, EXTRA.3, EXTRA.8, EXTRA.9, EXTRA.12,
    and EXTRA.17 have not been merged. These dictionaries contain
    180K assorted medical, biological and biochemical terms and
    phrases.
    <p>
    Olde news. Merged into mainline in version 4.5
    </dd>

<dt><b>BioLG</b></dt>
<dd>The <a href="http://mars.cs.utu.fi/biolg/">BioLG</a> project is
    a modification of the Link Grammar Parser adapted for the
    biomedical domain, as described in
    <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/S3/S2">Lexical
    Adaptation of Link Grammar to the Biomedical Sublanguage: a
    Comparative Evaluation of Three Approaches (Sampo Pyysalo,
    Tapio Salakoski, Sophie Aubin and Adeline Nazarenko; BMC
    Bioinformatics 2006)</a>. Almost all of the BioLG changes
    have been merged back into the main line, as of version 4.5.0
    (April 2009), with scattered bug-fixes after that.
