<tt>ER</tt> is used in the construction "the X-er..., the Y-er...":
    
<PRE>
         +------ER----------+
    +-DG-+                  +-DG-+
    |    |                  |    |
   The better it is,       the more people will use it
   The more people use it, the better it is
</PRE>

Such constructions always use comparative adjectives or
adverbs. They consist essentially of two similar phrases,
attached together by an 
<tt><a href="section-ER.html">ER</a></tt>
link. (Any phrase that can occur in
the first half can occur in the second, as the above examples
suggest.) The comparative adjective is always the "head" of
each phrase. Each comparative adjective must have the capacity
to serve as either the first or second half of the
expression. The complement links (i.e., those that connect
within the phrase) are the same, whether the adjective is
serving as a "first-half" or a "second-half".  Such adjectives
therefore have:

<PRE>
bigger: ( complement ) & DG- & ((Wd- & Xc+ & ER+) or ER-)
            
                                ----------------      ^ 
                                 for first-half  for second-half
                                   phrase           phrase
</PRE>

The <tt><a href="section-DG.html">DG-</a></tt> connects to the
definite article "the"; the 
<tt><a href="section-X.html">Xc+</a></tt>
connects to a comma; the
<tt><a href="section-W.html">Wd-</a></tt>
to the wall; and the
<tt><a href="section-ER.html">ER</a></tt>
from one phrase to the other.
<P>
The connectors used within the phrase are mostly those
discussed elsewhere:

<PRE>
	The bigger it is	<a href="section-AF.html">AF+</a>
	The more you run	<a href="section-C.html">Cs+</a>
	The more you earn	<a href="section-B.html">B+</a>
	The more money you earn <a href="section-D.html">Dm*w+</a>
</PRE>
						
An exception is the following construction:

<PRE>
         +-TR--+--U---+
         |     |      |
   The better the computer , the faster the program
</PRE>

For such constructions, the word "the" has
<tt>"<a href="section-TR.html">TR-</a> &amp; <a href="section-U.html">U+</a>"</tt>.
Nouns have <tt><a href="section-U.html">U-</a></tt>;
this special connector is disjoined with
all other optional and mandatory connectors on nouns
(except 
<tt><a href="section-AN.html">AN-</a></tt>
and
<tt><a href="section-A.html">A-</a></tt>).
