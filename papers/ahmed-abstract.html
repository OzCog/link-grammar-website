    <h2>Ahmed, A Note on Phrase Structure Analysis and Design
    Implication for ICALL. (Abstract)</h2>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Exploiting Chomsky's Universal Grammar (UG), this research examines
the effects of phrase
     structure rules on the development of grammatical knowledge in
     Bangladeshi learners of English as a
     second language. The masking technique of MacWhinney (1988)
     motivates using the
     link-grammar syntactic parser of Sleator & Temperley (1993) for
     this study. The results indicate
     that the learners' parameters were reset from L1 to L2 as a
     consequence of the overt presentation of
     phrase structure rules. The implications of the study for the
     design of intelligent computer assisted
     language learning is discussed.
