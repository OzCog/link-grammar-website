<tt>CP</tt> is used with verbs like "say", which can be used
in a quotation or paraphrase:

<PRE>
     +-------------------CP---------------------+
     |                        +-------Xd--------+
     |                        |         +---S---+-Xc-+
     |                        |         |       |    |
  ///// The President is busy , the spokesman said /////
</PRE>

Verbs that can take quotational complements of this kind have
"<tt>CP-</tt>", directly disjoined with their other complement
connectors.
The verb must connect to commas on either side (or to the right-
hand wall); see "<tt><A HREF="section-X.html">Xc</A></tt>".
Direct quotations, with quotation marks, use the
<tt><A HREF="section-QU.html">QU</A></tt> connector to explicitly
locate the quoted phrase or sentence.
<PRE>
  say: (S- or I-...) & (O+ or Ce+ or TH+ or (Xd- & Xc+ & CP-));
</PRE>

Verbs that can be used this way can usually also be placed 
elsewhere in the sentence - either after an opener (ex. 1), or
after the subject phrase (ex. 2). In the first case, they use
<tt><a href="section-CO.html">COq</a></tt>;
in the second case, they use <tt><a href="section-E.html">Eq</a></tt>. 
<PRE>

                +-------------S---------------+
                |                       +-Eq--+
                |                       |     |
1.	The President , the spokesman said , is busy

        +---------------------CO--------------------+
        |                              +-----COq----+
        |                              |            |
2.	At the moment , the spokesman said , the President is busy
</PRE>

Verbs such as "say" therefore have the following:

<PRE>
	(S- or I-) & (O+ ... or (Xd- & Xc+ & (CP- or Eq+ or COq-)));
</PRE>

The category of verbs that can take quotations like this cuts
across other verb categories. For that reason, it seemed
simpler to designate new dictionary entries for
quotation-taking verbs; these entries have only the complement
connectors used in quotation (<tt>CP</tt>, <tt>Eq</tt>, and
<tt>COq</tt>). Such entries are subscripted with
"<tt>.q</tt>" ("<tt>say.q</tt>", etc.).
<P>
Quotation complement connectors - <tt>CP</tt>, <tt>Eq</tt>, and 
<tt>COq</tt> - are all
domain-starting. The structures created in such sentences are
rather unusual, however. With domains, the usual principle is
to have embedded clauses nested inside the domains of main
clauses. In cases of quotation, it would seem (semantically
anyway) that the quoting verb (e.g. "say") is the main clause,
and the quotation itself is dependent on it. Therefore, we
make the quoting expression start a domain which includes the
quoted expression. In the case of <tt>Eq</tt>, and
<tt>COq</tt>, these links are simply made domain-starting links.
In the case of <tt>CP</tt>, the "<tt>Wd</tt>"
connector on the wall already starts a domain which only
includes the quoted statement. <tt>CP</tt> is then made to start an
"urfl" domain (of type 'd'), which includes both the quoted
statement and the quoting statement.

     +-------------------CP(d)------------------+
     |                        +-------Xd(d)-----+
     +-S(d(m))-+              |         +--S(d)-+Xc(d)+
     |         |              |         |       |     |
  /////	The President is busy , the spokesman said  /////

<H3>CPi: Filler-it paraphrasing</H3>
<tt>CPi</tt> is used with verbs taking paraphrase statements which
also require "filler-it" as subject: "The President is busy,
it seems". See "<A HREF="section-SF.html">SF</A>: filler-it".

<H3>CPu: Thoughts and desires</H3>
<tt>CPu</tt> is used with verbs that express beliefs, hopes, thoughts,
desires, knowledge, assertions, etc. It interacts heavily with the
<tt><A HREF="section-VC.html">VCz</A></tt> link, as well with the head-verb
connectors <tt><A HREF="section-WV.html">WV</A></tt> and
<tt><A HREF="section-CV.html">CV</A></tt> to identify the verbs in the sentence,
together with their roles.
<PRE>
      +------------------------->CPu------------------------->+
      +--------->WV------->+                                  |
      +----->Wd-----+      +------VCz-----+---------CV------->+
      |      +--Ds--+--Ss--+--Pa--+    +Xd+-Sa*a+--I---+--Pv--+
      |      |      |      |      |    |  |     |      |      |
  LEFT-WALL the  accused   is innocent ,  as  shall    be   proven  
</PRE>

This verb class generally includes the mental-state and mental-act
verbs, and some passive performative verbs ("<tt>the accused is
innocent, as recognized by this court</tt>").

<H3>CPa, CPx: Topic-less paraphrasing</H3>
<tt>CPa</tt> and <tt>CPx</tt> is used for paraphrasing-like
constructions in which the paraphrased content (the topic) is
absent. <tt>CPx</tt> is used for direct assertions:
<PRE>
       +-------->CPx--------+
       +->Wa--+     +---Ss--+-Xp-+
       |      |     |       |    |
   LEFT-WALL so everyone   says  .
</PRE>
<tt>CPa</tt> is used for inverted subjects:
<PRE>
      +---->CPa----+------Xc------+
      |      +--Em-+--SIsj--+     |
      |      |     |        |     |
  LEFT-WALL so   thinks everyone  .
