<P>
<tt>SFI</tt> connects "filler" subjects "it" and "there" to invertible
verbs in questions with subject-verb inversion:

<PRE>
        +SFI+
        |   |
        Is it likely that Jane will go
        Is there going to be a problem
</PRE>

Both the use of "it" and "there" and the use of subject-verb
inversion are highly constrained by post-processing (see 
"<A HREF="section-SF.html"><tt>SF</tt></A>";
see "<A HREF="section-SI.html"><tt>SI</tt></A>").
However, there is nothing especially problematic
about <tt>SFI</tt>; <tt>SFI</tt> is to <tt>SF</tt> precisely as
<tt>SI</tt> is to <tt>S</tt>.
