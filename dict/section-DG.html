<p>
<tt>DG</tt> connects the word "the" with proper nouns. In general, proper nouns 
may not take determiners; but we do allow proper nouns to take
the determiner "the". This allows things like
<pre>
   The Emir of Kuwait died.
   The Supreme Soviet met today.
</pre>
but not
<pre>
   *I have known many Kuwaits.
   *We need a Soviet.
</pre>
Other uses of determiners with proper nouns are allowed with cost 2; see 
"<tt><A HREF="section-D.html">D</A></tt>: Determiners with Proper Nouns".
<p>
<tt>DG</tt> is used in the construction "The X-er, the Y-er." 
See "<tt><A HREF="section-ER.html">ER</A></tt>".
It is also used in certain idiomatic time expressions like "I
left the moment I saw him"; see "<tt><A
HREF="section-TT.html">TT</A></tt>".
