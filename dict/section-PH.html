<tt>PH</tt> helps enforce correct usage of the phonetic "an" vs. "a" 
for nouns and adjectives beginning with a vowel.

          +----Ds**x---+
          +-PHc+---A---+
          |    |       |
    I ate a  green   apple   

           +--------Ds**x--------+
           |     +-------A-------+
           +-PHv-+       +---A---+
           |     |       |       |
    I ate an  edible   green   apple   

          +-Ds**v-+
          |       |
    I ate an    apple   
</PRE>

The determiner "a" has the disjuncts
<tt>(Ds**c+ or (PHc+ &amp; Ds**x+)</tt>
on it, while "an" has
<tt>(Ds**v+ or (PHv+ &amp; Ds**x+)</tt>.
<p>
The connector <tt>Ds**c+</tt> allows "a" to link only to nouns that
begin with a consonant, unless there is an intervening modifier that
begins with a vowel.  In that case, the disjunct 
<tt>PHc+ &amp; Ds**x+</tt> is used. The <tt>PHc+</tt> prevents "a"
from linking to any words immediately on the right that begin with
a vowel. The <tt>Ds**x+</tt> links to any noun, as it is now too
distant for any phonetic modification to have an effect.
