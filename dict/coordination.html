<H2>Conjunction overview</H2>

<P>
Earlier versions of the Link Grammar parser (those prior to version 
4.7.0) used a different, special technique for parsing sentences 
containing coordinating conjunctions and other correlative structures.
This technique, known as "fat links", and described 
<A HREF="coordination-old.html">here</A>,
proved to have a number of disadvantages, was deprecated in version
4.7.0 (2010), and finally removed in version 5.2.0 (2014).  What
follows is a description of the current mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Conjunction refers to the joining together different parsts of a sentence
using either coordinating conjunctions, correlative conjunctions, or
subordinating conjunctions.  The most common coordinating conjunctions
are <i>and, or, nor, but</i>, and are used to join together
two grammatically similar or identical words or phrases.  Correlative
conjunctions and subordinating conjunctions are set phrases enforcing more 
complex, long-range structure.  Examples include
<i>either ... or ..., not only ... but also ..., if ... then ...</i>, and
so on.  Conjunctions of any of these types are (mostly) handled by the same
technique within link grammar, although there is some variation.  The
strongest link grammar patterns occur for coordinating conjunctions,
which are supported by a half-dozen distinct link types, roughly aligned 
with the part-of-speech or gramatical type of the words or phrases involved.
These links include:
<ul>
<li><A NAME="AJ" HREF="section-AJ.html"><STRONG>AJ</STRONG></A>,
   used for coordinating adjectives, such as "The BLACK AND WHITE 
   cat sleeps."
<li><A NAME="MJ" HREF="section-MJ.html"><STRONG>MJ</STRONG></A>,
   used for coordinating prepositions and other post-nominal modifiers, 
   such as "It is hidden IN OR NEAR the house."
<li><A NAME="NI" HREF="section-NI.html"><STRONG>NI</STRONG></A>,
   used for numerical ranges, such as "It takes  2 to 3 times the effort."
<li><A NAME="QJ" HREF="section-QJ.html"><STRONG>QJ</STRONG></A>,
   used for coordinating question words, such as "WHEN AND WHERE is the party?"
<li><A NAME="RJ" HREF="section-RJ.html"><STRONG>RJ</STRONG></A>,
   used for coordinating adverbs and other miscellaneous constructions, such as
   "She did it QUICKLY AND QUIETLY."
<li><A NAME="SJ" HREF="section-SJ.html"><STRONG>SJ</STRONG></A>,
   used for coordinating nouns, such as "JOHN AND MARY are coming to the party."
<li><A NAME="VJ" HREF="section-VJ.html"><STRONG>VJ</STRONG></A>,
   used for coordinating verbs, such as "He RAN AND JUMPED"
<li><A NAME="XJ" HREF="section-XJ.html"><STRONG>XJ</STRONG></A>,
   used for miscellaneous idiomatic coordinating expressions, such as 
   "... NOT ONLY x, BUT y": "You should NOT ONLY ask for your money
   back, BUT demand it."
<li><A NAME="V" HREF="section-V.html"><STRONG>V</STRONG></A>,
   used for miscellaneous adpositions, such as "... TOOK ... FOR GRANTED".
<li><A NAME="VC" HREF="section-VC.html"><STRONG>VC</STRONG></A>,
   used for connecting subordinate clauses, such as 
   "He STAYED SO he could see her".
</ul>
<P>
Many of these link types have several common, recurring themes in their 
structure and use. In general, these links only connect words with the
same part-of-speech. Thus, for example: "The black and white 
cat sleeps" gives the following parse:

<pre>
       +-------------Ds-------------+        
       |             +-------A------+        
       |     +--AJl--+--AJr--+      +---Ss--+
       |     |       |       |      |       |
      the black.a and.j-a white.a cat.n sleeps.v 
</pre>
Here, the <A HREF="section-AJ.html">AJ</A> link connects each adjective
to the conjunction "and". The resulting conjunction behaves as if it
were an adjective itself: so "and" will link to "cat" with the
<A HREF="section-A.html">A</A> link, just as an ordinary adjective would.
This arrangement is sometimes refered to as a "Prague style" dependency.
It imposes a fundamentally hierarchical ordering: "and" acts as a
head-word, with two dependent words: "black" and "white"; the combined
phrase "black and white" acts as a single adjective.  This style for 
handling coordination is used for other parts of speech as well; so, 
for example, <A HREF="section-SJ.html">SJ</A> links combine nouns into
a noun phrase:
<pre>
                +------Spx------+       +----Js----+
         +-SJls-+--SJrs-+       +--MVa--+    +--Ds-+
         |      |       |       |       |    |     |
      Jack.b and.j-n Jill.f fell.v-d down.r the hill.n 
</pre>
Here, the conjoined "Jack and Jill" acts as a (plural) subject.
</P>
<P>
The subtypes <tt>AJl</tt> and <tt>AJr</tt>, standing for "left" and
"right", are used to maintain proper sequential ordering; this is
useful for properly managing comma-conjoined lists:
<pre>
       +-------------------Ds------------------+        
       |          +-----AJl-----+-------A------+        
       |     +-AJl+-AJr-+       +--AJr--+      +---Ss--+
       |     |    |     |       |       |      |       |
      the black.a , orange.a and.j-a white.a cat.n sleeps.v 
</pre>
The <tt>l,r</tt> subtype is also used for most of the other links
(so, for example, <tt>VJl</tt> and <tt>VJr</tt>), with
a few exceptions: the <A HREF="section-NI.html">NI</A> link uses 
<tt>NIf</tt> and <tt>NIt</tt> subtypes for numerical ranges, indicating
the "from" and "to" ends of the range.
</P>
<P>
Other subtypes are used for enforcing agreement of various sorts,
such as number and tense; so, for example: "cars and trucks are vehicles"
but "*car and truck are vehicles", "*car and truck is vehicle". 
Agreement is discussed in greater detail in each individual link-type
page.
</P>
<P>
The basic mechanism shown above can be extended to, and employed for any sort
of multi-word correlative conjunctions, such as "neither ... nor ..." or
"not only ... but also ...". Agreement between the various parts is
enforced by means of the <A HREF="section-XJ.html"><tt>XJ</tt></a> link.
So, for example:
<pre>
        +------XJn------+------S*x-----+       
        |        +-SJls-+--SJrs-+      +---I--+
        |        |      |       |      |      |
    neither.r Jack.b nor.j-n Jill.f will.v come.v 
</pre>
</P>

<H3>Miscellaneous Idiomatic Correlating Expressions</H3>
<P>
Although the words "and", "or" are the conjunctions most commonly used
to correlate words and phrases, there are also many more complex 
idiomatic expressions that are used for coordination.  These include:
<ul>
<li>Not only ... but also ...
<li>First ... next ...
<li>If ... then ...
<li>If .. only ...  "If there were only more like you"
<li>ought ... if ... "That ought to be the case, if John is not lying"
<li>Someone ... who ...  "Someone is outside who wants to see you"
<li>It ... that ...  "It seemed likely that John would go"
<li>...from X and from Y
<li>By X, and by Y, ...
</ul>
Few of the above are implemented; those that are, are handled with the 
<a href="section-XJ.html"><tt>XJ</tt></a>,
<a href="section-RJ.html"><tt>RJ</tt></a> and
<a href="section-V.html"><tt>V</tt></a> links.
</P>

<H3>Known problems</H3>
<P>
The implementation of the <tt>VC</tt> link is irregular, and overlaps
significantly with the <tt>MVs</tt> link.  It also behaves very
differrently from how the <tt>AJ</tt>, <tt>SJ</tt>, and <tt>VJ</tt>
are implemented.  Both <tt>VC</tt> and <tt>MVs</tt> need review, and
possibly, redesign.
</P>
<P>
The <tt>V</TT> link deals with adpositions, but somewhat irregularly.
Notice how the adpositions have a conjoining-like behaviour, but different ... 
The overall theory should be clarified &amp; unified. See the README file
that is shipped with the distro for more information.
</P>
<H3>The problem of complex verbs</H3>
<P>
The "Prague style" dependency works well when the conjoined words/phrases
have a simple relationship to the rest of the sentence, but are
problematic for more complex verb phrase conjunctions.  Consider the
sentence <i>I taught these mice to jump, and those mice to freeze.</i>
The first part of the sentence
<pre>
            +-------TOo-----+
            +---Op------+   |
       +-Sp-+     +-Dmc-+   +-I-+
       |    |     |     |   |   |
       I taught these mice to jump
</pre>
shows that <i>taught</i> acts as a head-word, and has two links to the
right: the object link <tt>Op</tt> and the <tt>TOo</tt> link. A similar
linkage is desired for the second half of the sentence; but how should
this be acheived? There are two possibilities; neither are implemented
by the current version of link-grammar, for reasons explained below.
</P>
<P>
The first possibility is to imprint the verb-linking rules onto the
conjunction, asking <i>and</i> to behave as if it were a verb:
<pre>
            +-----------V*taught----+
            +------TOo--            +-------TOo----+
            +---Op--                +---Op-----+   |
       +-Sp-+                       |    +-Dmc-+   +-I-+
       |    |                       |    |     |   |   |
       I taught these mice to jump and those mice to freeze
</pre>
In the above, the verb <i>taught</i> links as usual, but also sports a
custom <tt>VJ</tt> link to <i>and</i> that makes the <i>and</i> behave
just like the verb. The problem with this scheme is that there are many
exceptional verb linkages, and this requires a custom <tt>VJ</tt> link
for each exceptional case (so that the correct linkage for <i>and</i> 
can be forced).
</P>
<P>
The second possibility is to attach all of the links to the conjunction,
as below:
<pre>
            +-----V*super*and-------+
            |          +--Op -------+-------TOo----+
            |          |    +--TOo--+---Op-----+   |
       +-Sp-+               |       |    +-Dmc-+   +-I-+
       |    |                       |    |     |   |   |
       I taught these mice to jump and those mice to freeze
</pre>
The above somewhat resembles the simple "Prague style" conjunction
linkage, but is also dis-satisfying: by forcing both left- and 
right-directed links onto the <i>and</i>, it makes it difficult
or even impossible to determine the verb-phrase structure of the
sentence. Do all left-facing links form one one verb-phrase, and all
right-facing links form another? Or perhaps some of the left and
right-facing links should be grouped into one verb-phrase, and the
remainder into another?  This could be clarified by adding 
"phantom nodes" to indicate the desired grouping; however, the 
current link grammar has absolutely no concept of a "phantom node".
</P>
<P>
Given these two choices, the first possibility appears to be the most
natural, as it offers the greatest fidelity to verb-phrase structure.
It does introduce the concept of "link transferance onto the conjunction"
in order to make it workable. Although this can be implemented within
the current theory of link-grammar, it does force the <i>and</i> to be
festooned with a large variety of linkage rules, one for each
exceptional verb linakge. There is currently no way of instructing the
parser to treat the <i>and</i> "just like the verb before it".
