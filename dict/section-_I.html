<p>
<b><tt>_I</tt></b> is a special class of link-types that is generated by the
parser for idiomatic strings listed in the dictionary.

<PRE>
        at_hand in_store: MVp- or Mp- or Pp-...

               +-Pp-+-_ITB-+
               |    |      |
        Peace is   at    hand
</PRE>

Note that the <b><tt>_ITB</tt></b> link used here is not explicitly
listed in the dictionary. Rather, the phrase "at_hand" is simply
listed as an idiomatic string. In reading in the dictionary, the parser
generates arbitrary link names, always beginning with the letters
<b><tt>_I</tt></b>, to link the words of the idiom together.
<p>
Little can be said in general about idiomatic expressions.
Probably the largest category are prepositional-phrase-like
constructions which cannot be handled as ordinary
prepositional phrases for some reason. In the case of "at
hand", for example, the singular noun "hand" normally requires
a determiner. Some idioms are more like adverbs, in that they
cannot be complements of "be": "by_car", "in_turn". Some are
actually like prepositions, modifying a noun or verb and
taking another noun as an object: "next_to", "in_back_of". And
some are like conjunctions, taking a clausal complement:
"now_that", "in_case". The dictionary also includes a few
idiomatic noun phrases ("head_of_state") and verbs ("do_so").
