<P>
<b><tt>MG</tt></b> allows certain prepositions to modify proper nouns. We do
not allow most prepositions to modify proper nouns ("*John
with the big nose is here") but we do allow it with "of" and
"for": "The Society for Creative Anachronisms is meeting",
"The Ongle of Bongle Dongle died today"). <tt>MG</tt> must be used with
<tt><a href="section-JG.html">JG</a></tt>, forcing the object of the preposition also to be
capitalized ("The Society for Creative Anachronisms is
meeting", "*The Society for creative anachronisms is
meeting").
